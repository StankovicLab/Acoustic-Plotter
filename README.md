## SUMMARY:
Application for veiwing and finding thresholds of ABRs and DPOAEs created by the TDT software BioSigRZ

## DESCRIPTION:
Use this application to open .arf files created by TDT BioSigRZ software. Can view ABRs and DPOAEs and export data as an excel or as Matlab data.

Thresholds are semiautomatically determined
DPOAE thresholds are determined when DP's are greater than 3x the standard deviation above the mean. ([Bartho et al. 2020](https://github.com/CDTbot/CDTbot))
ABR thresholds are determined using a method of cross correlation described by [Suthakar & Liberman 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heares.2019.107782)
