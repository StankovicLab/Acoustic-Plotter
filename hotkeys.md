## HOTKEYS:

- up/down arrows -> scroll through levels
- 'enter' -> make selected level new threshold
- '+'/'-' -> increase/decrease the amplitude of waveforms
- 'n' -> normalize amplitudes to best fit window
- while holding down ctrl
  - up/down arrows -> scoll through mice
  - right/left arrows -> scoll through frequencies within a single mouse

  
  (if hotkeys not working, click on the main figure and try again. Only works if main figure is selected)
  
  #### Peakfinder
  
- ‘p’ -> activate peakfinder and estimate P1-5 
- right/left arrows -> move a toggled peak left or right along the waveform. Movement of the peak will ‘snap’ to the next estimated peak in the waveform or by hold down ‘shift’ + right/left arrow will finely move the peak along the waveform
- number keys 1-5 -> select the corresponding peak on the current waveform. To select N1-5, hold down ‘shift’ while pressing the corresponding number
- ‘i’ ->  estimate N1-5 
- ‘u’ -> updates guess of selected peak/node based of successive waveforms based on position of currently toggled P or N
