## HOTKEYS:

- up/down arrows -> scroll through levels
- 'enter' -> make selected level new threshold
- '+'/'-' -> increase/decrease the amplitude of waveforms
- 'n' -> normalize amplitudes to best fit window
- while holding down ctrl
  - up/down arrows -> scoll through mice
  - right/left arrows -> scoll through frequencies within a single mouse
  
  
  (if hotkeys not working, click on the main figure and try again. Only works if main figure is selected)
