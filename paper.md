## Summary

The `AcousticPlotter` application provides researchers with a simplified interface for viewing, comparing, grouping, and selecting thresholds of auditory electrophysiological data: auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Created using Matlab’s application compiler, `AcousticPlotter` is designed for researchers using TDT’s BioSigRZ software. Audiometric thresholds are semi-automatic determined is based upon the algorithms of Suthakar & Liberman (2019) for ABRs and Bartho et al. (2020) for DPOAEs. Thresholds can also be manually set. Waveform data, groupings information, and thresholds are all able to be exported into Excel or Matlab files. Publication ready figures are also able to be saved in a variety of picture formats. Finally, `AcousticPlotter` has an extra feature to edit and combine datasets in aid researchers when experiments didn't go as planned and multiple tests need to be combined or expluded. 

## Statement of Need

Many auditory research labs use Tucker and Davis Technologies (TDT) equipment to perform ABR and DPOAE testing in humans and animals. ABRs, or auditory brainstem response, are sound evoked neural responses used to access the limits of hearing in humans and lab animals and appear as a 5-peak waveform when heard. DPOAEs, or distortion product otoacoustic emissions, is the response generated by the outer hair cells of the cochlea (inner ear) when stimulated simultaneously by two pure tones. TDT’s software, BioSigRZ, provides a powerful interface for collecting these data, however, BioSigRZ was not designed for analysis. Analysis using BioSigRZ is clucky and does not provide publication ready images. Additionally, users who are not completely familiar with the software feel intimidated by BioSigRZ’s complexity. The included Matlab-based application, AcousticPlotter, provides a simplified interface for analyzing (viewing, comparing, and setting thresholds) and organizing data collected on BioSigRZ.

Most software for viewing ABR and DPOAE data are designed for clinical diagnoses and provide little ability for more detailed analysis as may be required in research. Additionally, most of these software are proprietary and tied to the hardware that originally collected the data and cannot view the ARF files generated by BioSigRZ. The software, ABR Peak Analysis by Eaton-Peabody Laboratory’s engineering core cannot import ARF files and can only view ABRs, one at a time. AcousticPlotter is designed to import ARF files, can view both ABR and DPOAE files, and can compare multiple subjects at once thus making it an ideal tool for quick analysis of ABR and DPOAE data.

ABR and DPOAE thresholds are the primary analysis used for determining the health of a subject’s hearing. For ABRs, however, most thresholds are determined visually as the lowest stimulus level to evoke a waveform with at least 1 peak. and is therefore subject to subjectivity (Vidler & Parker, 2004). A number of automated algorithms have been developed to determine ABR threshold [@(Acir et al., 2006]; Berninger et al., 2014; Bogaerts et al., 2009; Cebulla et al., 2000; Davey et al., 2007; Don et al., 1984; Sanchez et al., 1995; Sininger, 1993; Vannier et al., 2002; Wong & Bickford, 1980). AcousticPlotter uses a method based on the cross correlation of ABRs to sequential stimulus levels to determine threshold, a method outlined by Suthakar & Liberman (2019). Although this method performs well for most ABRs, it is still prone to error due to small or incomplete datasets, high signal-to-noise ratios, and common artifacts. It is therefore important for the user to inspect thresholds and adjust as necessary, which AcousticPlotter make easy to do. DPOAE thresholds are also automatically determine in AcousticPlotter and are defined as the lowest stimulation level that produces a distortion product (DP) is at least 3x greater than the standard deviation above the mean of the surrounding spectrum (Bartho et al. 2020). 

AcousticPlotter makes it easy to group and compare thresholds of different subjects. While this is not a difficult task to perform in software like Excel, Matlab, Stata, etc., it is an additional step research must take to analyze data. Once thresholds are determined, AcousticPlotter provides a feature for displaying threshold vs frequency plots in which subjects can be viewed individually or grouped. Grouped data is displayed as the mean with error bars of either standard deviation or standard error.

Finally, AcousticPlotter allows users to make corrections to datasets. It is not uncommon for a subject to move or wake up during an experiment, resulting in bad data that may need to be recollected. The original, bad, data is sorted in the original TDT generated data set but may cause issues in data analysis. Using the Combine Files GUI feature allows users to edit, combine, and delete trials to build a cleaner dataset.

In all AcousticPlotter is an open-source application for viewing ABR and DPOAE data collected by BioSigRZ, and determining and comparing thresholds between subjects. Addressing the need for a simplified software for performing these tasks in one software. Documentation and source code is provided on Github, along with example ARF files.
