	abstract = {Purpose of review Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) produces benign Schwann cell tumors on many cranial nerves, in particular on the vestibular portions of the VIIIn bilaterally. Removal of these vestibular schwannomas usually severs the auditory portion of the VIIIn, thus deafening the patients. The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) was designed to provide prosthetic electric stimulation of the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem to restore some hearing sensations to patients deafened by bilateral removal of vestibular schwannomas. This study will review the new developments and improving outcomes of the ABI. Recent findings From its initial application in 1979 until about 2005, the ABI provided modest but useful auditory sensations to NF2 patients. However, application of the ABI in non-NF2 populations and in children with congenital malformations demonstrated better results, showing that the ABI could provide high levels of speech recognition. Recent results show excellent speech recognition in NF2 patients as well. This study will discuss the potential causes of the variability in ABI outcomes. Summary ABIs activate neurons in the cochlear nucleus to recreate hearing sensations in people who have become deaf as a result of the loss of the auditory nerve. Most NF2 patients show functional hearing benefit from the ABI, with awareness and recognition of environmental sounds and enhancement of lipreading. It is now clear that ABIs can produce excellent speech recognition in some patients with NF2, allowing even conversational telephone use. Although the factors leading to this improved performance are not completely clear, these new results show that excellent hearing is possible for NF2 patients with the ABI.},

Design: Between September 1992 and October 1997 a total of 27 subjects received a Nucleus 20-or 21-channel Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI). All subjects involved in the trial had bilateral acoustic tumour as a result of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) resulting in complete dysfunction of the VIIIth nerve. The study used each subject as their own control without a preoperative baseline be-cause residual hearing, if existing, was destroyed at surgery by tumour removal. A battery of speech tests was conducted to evaluate each patient's per-formance and communication abilities. Tests were conducted, where possible, in the auditory-only, visual-only, and auditory-visual conditions at 3 days postoperatively (baseline), at 3-mo intervals for the first year and every 12 mo thereafter. A subjective performance questionnaire was adminis-tered together with an extensive neurological ex-amination at each test interval. Results: 27 subjects involved in this trial were suc-cessfully implanted with a Nucleus ABI. One subject died 2 days postoperatively due to a lung embolism unrelated to the device. Twenty-six subjects under-went device activation and all but one patient re-ceived auditory sensation at initial stimulation (96.2\%). On average 8.6 (؎4.2) of the available 21 electrodes were used in the patients' MAPs. Perfor-mance evaluation measures showed that the major-ity of users had access to auditory information such as environmental sound awareness together with stress and rhythm cues in speech that assist with lipreading. Although most subjects did not achieve any functional auditory-alone, open-set speech un-derstanding, two subjects from this series (7.4\%) did receive sufficient benefit to be able to use the ABI in conversation without lipreading.},

	abstract = {Studies of congenital and early-onset deafness have demonstrated that an absence of peripheral sound-evoked activity in the auditory nerve causes pathological changes in central auditory structures. The aim of this study was to establish whether progressive acquired hearing loss could lead to similar brain changes that would degrade the precision of signal transmission. We used complementary physiologic hearing tests and microscopic techniques to study the combined effect of both magnitude and duration of hearing loss on one of the first auditory synapses in the brain, the endbulb of Held (EB), along with its bushy cell (BC) target in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. We compared two hearing mouse strains (CBA/Ca and heterozygous shaker-2+/−) against a model of early-onset progressive hearing loss (DBA/2) and a model of congenital deafness (homozygous shaker-2−/−), examining each strain at 1, 3, and 6 months of age. Furthermore, we employed a frequency model of the mouse cochlear nucleus to constrain our analyses to regions most likely to exhibit graded changes in hearing function with time. No significant differences in the gross morphology of EB or BC structure were observed in 1-month-old animals, indicating uninterrupted development. However, in animals with hearing loss, both EBs and BCs exhibited a graded reduction in size that paralleled the hearing loss, with the most severe pathology seen in deaf 6-month-old shaker-2−/−mice. Ultrastructural pathologies associated with hearing loss were less dramatic: minor changes were observed in terminal size but mitochondrial fraction and postsynaptic densities remained relatively stable. These results indicate that acquired progressive hearing loss can have consequences on auditory brain structure, with prolonged loss leading to greater pathologies. Our findings suggest a role for early intervention with assistive devices in order to mitigate long-term pathology and loss of function.},

	abstract = {Auditory prostheses can partially restore speech comprehension when hearing fails. Sound coding with current prostheses is based on electrical stimulation of auditory neurons and has limited frequency resolution due to broad current spread within the cochlea. In contrast, optical stimulation can be spatially confined, which may improve frequency resolution. Here, we used animal models to characterize optogenetic stimulation, which is the optical stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Optogenetic stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) activated the auditory pathway, as demonstrated by recordings of single neuron and neuronal population responses. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of SGNs restored auditory activity in deaf mice. Approximation of the spatial spread of cochlear excitation by recording local field potentials (LFPs) in the inferior colliculus in response to suprathreshold optical, acoustic, and electrical stimuli indicated that optogenetic stimulation achieves better frequency resolution than monopolar electrical stimulation. Virus-mediated expression of a ChR2 variant with greater light sensitivity in SGNs reduced the amount of light required for responses and allowed neuronal spiking following stimulation up to 60 Hz. Our study demonstrates a strategy for optogenetic stimulation of the auditory pathway in rodents and lays the groundwork for future applications of cochlear optogenetics in auditory research and prosthetics.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) provides sound aware-ness to patients who are ineligible for cochlear implantation. Auditory performance varies widely among similar ABI cohorts. We hypothesize that differences in electrode array position contribute to this variance. Herein, we classify ABI array position based on postoperative imaging and investigate the relationship between position and perception. Design: Retrospective review of pediatric and adult ABI users with post-operative computed tomography. To standardize views across subjects, true axial reformatted series of scans were created using the McRae line. Using multiplanar reconstructions, basion and electrode array tip coordi-nates and array angles from vertical were measured. From a lateral view, array angles (V) were classified into types I to IV, and from posterior view, array angles (T) were classified into types A to D. Array position was further categorized by measuring distance vertical from basion (D1) and lateral from midline (D2). Differences between array classifications were compared with audiometric thresholds, number of active elec-trodes, and pitch ranking. Results: Pediatric (n = 4, 2 with revisions) and adult (n = 7) ABI subjects were included in this study. Subjects had a wide variety of ABI array angles, but most were aimed superiorly and posteriorly (type II, n = 7) from lateral view and upright or medially tilted from posterior view (type A, n = 6). Mean pediatric distances were 8 to 42\% smaller than adults for D1 and D2. In subjects with perceptual data, electrical thresholds and the number of active electrodes differed among classification types. Conclusions: In this first study to classify ABI electrode array orienta-tion, array position varied widely. This variability may explain differences in auditory performance.},

	abstract = {In everyday listening, sound reaches our ears directly from a source as well as indirectly via reflections known as reverberation. Reverberation profoundly distorts the sound from a source, yet humans can both identify sound sources and distinguish environments from the resulting sound, via mechanisms that remain unclear. The core computational challenge is that the acoustic signatures of the source and environment are combined in a single signal received by the ear. Here we ask whether our recognition of sound sources and spaces reflects an ability to separate their effects and whether any such separation is enabled by statistical regularities of real-world reverberation. To first determine whether such statistical regularities exist, we measured impulse responses (IRs) of 271 spaces sampled from the distribution encountered by humans during daily life. The sampled spaces were diverse, but their IRs were tightly constrained, exhibiting exponential decay at frequency-dependent rates: Mid frequencies reverberated longest whereas higher and lower frequencies decayed more rapidly, presumably due to absorptive properties of materials and air. To test whether humans leverage these regularities, we manipulated IR decay characteristics in simulated reverberant audio. Listeners could discriminate sound sources and environments from these signals, but their abilities degraded when reverberation characteristics deviated from those of real-world environments. Subjectively, atypical IRs were mistaken for sound sources. The results suggest the brain separates sound into contributions from the source and the environment, constrained by a prior on natural reverberation. This separation process may contribute to robust recognition while providing information about spaces around us.},

In this study, we aim to investigate regional brain structural and functional alterations in patients with UHL. T1-weighted volumetric images and task-free fMRIs were acquired from 14 patients with right-sided UHL (pure tone average≥40dB HL) and 19 healthy controls. Hearing ability was assessed by pure tone audiometry. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to detect brain regions with changed gray matter volume or white matter volume in UHL. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated to analyze brain activity at the baseline and was compared between two groups. Compared with controls, UHL patients showed decreased gray matter volume in bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, left superior/middle/inferior temporal gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus and lingual gyrus. Meanwhile, patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in bilateral precuneus, left inferior parietal lobule, and right inferior frontal gyrus and insula and increased ALFF in right inferior and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that chronic UHL could induce brain morphological changes and is associated with aberrant baseline brain activity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Globular bushy cells and two types of spherical bushy cells project to nuclei in the superior olivary complex that play roles in sound localization based on binaural cues. Octopus cells convey precisely timed information to nuclei in the superior olivary complex and lateral lemniscus that, in turn, send inhibitory input to the inferior colliculus. Cochlear root neurons send widespread projections to areas of the reticular formation involved in startle reflexes and autonomic functions. Type I multipolar cells may encode complex features of natural stimuli and send excitatory projections directly to the inferior colliculus. Type II multipolar cells send inhibitory projections to the contralateral cochlear nuclei. Fusiform cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus appear to be important for the localization of sounds based on spectral cues and send direct excitatory projections to the inferior colliculus. Giant cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus also project directly to the inferior colliculus; some of them may convey inhibitory inputs to the contralateral cochlear nucleus as well. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

In this review, we consider the current state of knowledge concerning the development of these neurons, their peripheral and central connections, and their influences on peripheral and central target cells. Relatively little is known about the cellular and molecular regulation of migration or the establishment of precise topographic connection to the hair cells or cochlear nucleus (CN) neurons. Studies of mice with neurotrophin deletions are beginning to yield increasing understanding of variations in ganglion cell survival and resulting innervation patterns, however. Finally, existing evidence suggests that while ganglion cells have little influence on the differentiation of their hair cell targets, quite the opposite is true in the brain. Ganglion cell innervation and synaptic activity are essential for normal development of neurons in the cochlear nucleus.},

These cells are also the target of inhibitory inputs whose function is not well understood. The present study examines the role of inhibition in the encoding of low-frequency sounds in the gerbil's AVCN. The presynaptic action potentials of endbulb terminals and postsynaptic action potentials of SBCs were monitored simultaneously in extracellular single-unit recordings in vivo. An input-output analysis of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity was performed for both spontaneous and acoustically driven activity. Two-tone stimulation and neuropharmacological experiments allowed the effects of neuronal inhibition and cochlear suppression on SBC activity to be distinguished. Ninety-one percent of SBCs showed significant neuronal inhibition. Inhibitory sidebands enclosed the high- or low-frequency, or both, sides of the excitatory areas of these units; this was reflected as a presynaptic to postsynaptic increase in frequency selectivity of up to one octave. Inhibition also affected the level-dependent responses at the characteristic frequency. Although in all units the presynaptic recordings showed monotonic rate-level functions, this was the case in only half of the postsynaptic recordings. In the other half of SBCs, postsynaptic inhibitory areas overlapped the excitatory areas, resulting in nonmonotonic rate-level functions. The results demonstrate that the sound-evoked spike activity of SBCs reflects the integration of acoustically driven excitatory and inhibitory input. The inhibition specifically affects the processing of the spectral, temporal, and intensity cues of acoustic signals.},

	abstract = {The superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) is a prominent periolivary cell group of the superior olivary complex. SPON neurons use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter and are contacted by large numbers of glycinergic and GABAergic punctate profiles, representing a dense inhibitory innervation from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and from collaterals of SPON axons, respectively. SPON neurons have low rates of spontaneous activity, respond preferentially to the offset of pure tones, and phase-lock to amplitude-modulated tones. To determine the roles of glycine and GABA in shaping SPON responses, we recorded from single units in the SPON of anesthetized rats before, during, and after application of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline, or both drugs applied simultaneously. Strychnine caused a major increase in spike counts during the stimulus presentation, followed by the disappearance of offset spikes. In half of the recorded units, bicuculline caused moderately increased firing during the stimulus. However, in 86\% of units bicuculline also caused a large increase in the magnitude of the offset response. Application of the drug cocktail caused increased spontaneous activity, dramatically increased spike counts during the stimulus presentation, and eliminated the offset response in most units. We conclude that glycinergic inhibition from the MNTB suppresses SPON spiking during sound stimulation and is essential in generating offset responses. GABAergic inhibition, presumably from intrinsic SPON collaterals, plays a subtler role, contributing in some cells to suppression of firing during the stimulus and in most cells to restrict firing after stimulus offset.},

	abstract = {Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) are currently indicated for patients older than 12 years with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who had bilateral schwannoma removed. Over the last 10 years, we have extended the indications for ABIs to nontumor children and adult patients with cochlear or cochlear nerve injuries or malfunctions who would not benefit from a cochlear implant. We have provided ABIs for patients with cochlear nerve aplasia and other injuries, and patients in whom any benefit was, or would be, severely compromised as in extensive cochlear ossification. In the present chapter we report our recent findings in adult ABI patients and compare the psychophysical and speech perception outcomes in tumor with those in nontumor patients. We demonstrate that the ABI can stimulate the central auditory system in a way that gives the ability of open set speech understanding, and can thus be indicated in nontumor adult patients who are not candidates for a cochlear implant. From April 1997 to January 2006, a total of 80 patients, 62 adults and 18 children, were fitted with ABIs in the University of Verona ENT Department; age ranged from 14 months to 70 years. Twenty-six patients had NF2 with bilateral vestibular schwannoma removal, and 54 had nontumor diseases of the cochlear nerve or cochlea. The retrosigmoid approach was used in all patients. All patients had a functioning implantation, and no complications were observed during the operation, activation as well as long-term use of the ABI. All patients, except 1 (NF2), reported auditory sensations with activation of various numbers of electrodes (from 5 to 21). Different electrodes elicited different pitch sensations. At 1 year after implantations nontumor adults scored from 12 to 100\% in open set speech perception tests (average 59\%), and tumor (NF2) patients scored from 5 to 30\% (average of 11\%). The differences between these results are statistically significantly (p {\textless} 0.01). To investigate the cause of the differences in performance between tumor and nontumor ABI recipients, a series of psychophysical tests were done consecutively in 39 adult patients with implants (25 nontumor and 14 tumor patients) from May 1999 to April 2004 and with a follow-up of at least 1 year. The outcome of this study shows that: (1) The ABIs allow most tumor and nontumor patients to experience improved communication as well as awareness of environmental sounds. (2) Nontumor patients had better hearing outcomes than tumor patients when the variation in the auditory benefit with the ABI in relation to the patient's underlying pathological conditions were taken into consideration. (3) A significant number of nontumor patients are able understand speech at a level comparable to that of the most successful cochlear implant users including conversational telephone use. (4) The ABI represents the tool for hearing rehabilitation in patients with profound hearing loss who cannot be fitted with cochlear implants.},

Response behaviour correlated with the unit type; primary-like, primary-like with notch and transient-chopper units showed a recovery from suppression that was very similar to that already reported in the auditory nerve. For chopper units the strength of the adaptation was correlated with the units regularity of spike discharge; sustained chopper (CS) units showed less suppression than transient choppers. Onset units showed complete suppression at short Δts. Pause/Build (PB) units responded with increased activity to the second tone. In contrast to previous studies in the cochlear nucleus the recovery from suppression or facilitation was well described by a single exponential function, enabling us to define a recovery time constant and a maximum suppression/facilitation. There appeared to be a hierarchy in the time constant of recovery with PB and CS units showing the longest recovery times and onset units showing the shortest. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Several issues remain, in particular with regard to the projection patterns and physiology of neurons that exit the CN dorsally via the dorsal (DAS), intermediate (IAS), and commissural stria. We studied these neurons physiologically and anatomically using the intra-axonal labeling method. Multipolar cells with onset chopper (O(C)) responses innervated the ipsilateral ventral and dorsal CN before exiting the CN via the commissural stria. Upon reaching the midline they turned caudally to innervate the opposite CN. No collaterals were seen innervating any olivary complex nuclei. Octopus cells typically showed onset responses with little or no sustained activity. The main axon used the IAS and followed one of two routes occasionally giving off olivary complex collaterals on their way to the contralateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). Here they can have elaborate terminal arbors that surround VNLL cells. Fusiform and giant cells have overlapping but not identical physiology. Fusiform but not giant cells typically show pauser or buildup responses. Axons of both cells exit via the DAS and take the same course to reach the contralateral IC without giving off any collaterals en route.},

Although synaptic timing and dynamics critically shape this computation, synaptic interactions with intrinsic ion channels have received less attention. Using paired somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings in gerbil brainstem slices together with compartmental modeling, we found that activation of K(v)1 channels by dendritic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) accelerated membrane repolarization in a voltage-dependent manner and actively improved the time resolution of synaptic integration. We found that a somatically biased gradient of K(v)1 channels underlies the degree of compensation for passive cable filtering during propagation of EPSPs in dendrites. Thus, both the spatial distribution and properties of K(v)1 channels are important for preserving binaural synaptic timing.},

T stellate cells receive 6.5 inputs. Octopus cells receive {\textgreater}60 inputs. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) components of eEPSCs were largest in T stellate, smaller in bushy, and smallest in octopus cells, and they were larger in neurons from younger than older mice.

Sensitivity to philanthotoxin (PhTX) and rectification in the intracellular presence of spermine indicate that AMPA receptors that mediate eEPSCs in T stellate cells contain more GluR2 subunits than those in bushy and octopus cells. The AMPA components of eEPSCs were briefer in bushy (0.5 ms half-width) than in T stellate and octopus cells (0.8-0.9 ms half-width). Widening of eEPSCs in the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ) indicates that desensitization shortens eEPSCs. CTZ-insensitive synaptic depression of the AMPA components was greater in bushy and octopus than in T stellate cells.},

In auditory brainstem pathways, topographic precision is present at very early stages in development, which may suggest that synaptic reorganization contributes little to the construction of precise tonotopic maps.

	abstract = {Auditory brainstem implants (ABI) have been used in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients in an attempt to restore hearing sensation, with limited clinical success. Factors associated with poor clinical outcomes for NF2 ABI patients include larger tumour size, longer duration of hearing loss, and brainstem distortion and/or deformation caused by tumours that compress the brainstem. The present study investigated changes in tuning properties of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons following compression of the contralateral cochlear nucleus (CN). The left CN in adult rats (n = 8) was exposed and a 32-channel acute recording probe inserted along the tonotopic gradient of the right IC. In 4 animals, an ethylene vinyl acetate bead was applied to the exposed CN. Three recordings were made corresponding to T(1) = 0 min (before compression), T(2) = 45 min (during compression) and T(3) = 225 min (following bead removal/recovery). Recordings consisted of a response area protocol using pure tones of various frequencies and intensities (1-44 kHz; 10-70 dB SPL) to determine the characteristic frequency for each probe site. Compression of the CN led to sharpened tuning curves, decreased spike rate, and increased threshold and characteristic frequency in the IC. Reversal of compression enabled these variables, excluding threshold, to recover to baseline. NF2 patients may have poorer ABI performance due to damage to the physical structure of the CN, resulting in alterations to the tonotopic organisation of the auditory pathway which may complicate ABI implantation and activation.},

However, unilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL) and cochlear ablation (CA) result in a major enhancement of contralateral excitation. The response properties of the contralateral excitation produced by CHL and CA are similar, suggesting similar pathways are involved for both types of hearing loss. Here we used the neurotoxin melittin to test the hypothesis that this "compensatory" contralateral excitation is mediated either by direct glutamatergic CN-commissural projections or by cholinergic neurons of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) that send collaterals to the VCN. Unit responses were recorded from the left VCN of anesthetized, unilaterally deafened guinea pigs (CHL via ossicular disruption, or CA via mechanical destruction). Neural responses were obtained with 16-channel electrodes to enable simultaneous data collection from a large number of single- and multiunits in response to ipsi- and contralateral tone burst and noise stimuli. Lesions of each pathway had differential effects on the contralateral excitation. We conclude that contralateral excitation has a fast and a slow component. The fast excitation is likely mediated by glutamatergic neurons located in medial regions of VCN that send their commissural axons to the other CN via the dorsal/intermediate acoustic striae. The slow component is likely mediated by the OCB collateral projections to the CN. Commissural neurons that leave the CN via the trapezoid body are an additional source of fast, contralateral excitation.},

A model of the CN that maps frequency representation in 3D would facilitate investigations of possible frequency specializations and pathologic changes that disturb frequency organization. Toward this goal, we reconstructed in 3D the trajectories of labeled auditory nerve (AN) fibers following multiunit recordings and dye injections in the anteroventral CN of the CBA/J mouse. We observed that each injection produced a continuous sheet of labeled AN fibers. Individual cases were normalized to a template using 3D alignment procedures that revealed a systematic and tonotopic arrangement of AN fibers in each subdivision with a clear indication of isofrequency laminae. The combined dataset was used to mathematically derive a 3D quantitative map of frequency organization throughout the entire volume of the CN. This model, available online (http://3D.ryugolab.com/), can serve as a tool for quantitatively testing hypotheses concerning frequency and location in the CN.},

	abstract = {Broadband transient sounds, such as clicks and consonants, activate a traveling wave in the cochlea. This wave evokes firing in auditory nerve fibers that are tuned to high frequencies several milliseconds earlier than in fibers tuned to low frequencies. Despite this substantial traveling wave delay, octopus cells in the brainstem receive broadband input and respond to clicks with submillisecond temporal precision. The dendrites of octopus cells lie perpendicular to the tonotopically organized array of auditory nerve fibers, placing the earliest arriving inputs most distally and the latest arriving closest to the soma. Here, we test the hypothesis that the topographic arrangement of synaptic inputs on dendrites of octopus cells allows octopus cells to compensate the traveling wave delay. We show that in mice the full cochlear traveling wave delay is 1.6 ms. Because the dendrites of each octopus cell spread across approximately one-third of the tonotopic axis, a click evokes a soma-directed sweep of synaptic input lasting 0.5 ms in individual octopus cells. Morphologically and biophysically realistic, computational models of octopus cells show that soma-directed sweeps with durations matching in vivo measurements result in the largest and sharpest somatic EPSPs. A low input resistance and activation of a low-voltage-activated potassium conductance that are characteristic of octopus cells are important determinants of sweep sensitivity. We conclude that octopus cells have dendritic morphologies and biophysics tailored to accomplish the precise encoding of broadband transient sounds.},

	abstract = {The inferior colliculus (IC) in the midbrain of the auditory system uses a unique basic circuit to organize the inputs from virtually all of the lower auditory brainstem and transmit this information to the medial geniculate body (MGB) in the thalamus. Here, we review the basic circuit of the IC, the neuronal types, the organization of their inputs and outputs. We specifically discuss the large GABAergic (LG) neurons and how they differ from the small GABAergic (SG) and the more numerous glutamatergic neurons. The somata and dendrites of LG neurons are identified by axosomatic glutamatergic synapses that are lacking in the other cell types and exclusively contain the glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Although LG neurons are most numerous in the central nucleus of the IC (ICC), an analysis of their distribution suggests that they are not specifically associated with one set of ascending inputs. The inputs to ICC may be organized into functional zones with different subsets of brainstem inputs, but each zone may contain the same three neuron types. However, the sources of VGLUT2 axosomatic terminals on the LG neuron are not known. Neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and IC itself that express the gene for VGLUT2 only are the likely origin of the dense VGLUT2 axosomatic terminals on LG tectothalamic neurons. The IC is unique since LG neurons are GABAergic tectothalamic neurons in addition to the numerous glutamatergic tectothalamic neurons. SG neurons evidently target other auditory structures. The basic circuit of the IC and the LG neurons in particular, has implications for the transmission of information about sound through the midbrain to the MGB.},

	abstract = {In the developing nervous system, spontaneous neuronal activity arises independently of experience or any environmental input. This activity may play a major role in axonal pathfinding, refinement of topographic maps, dendritic morphogenesis, and the segregation of axonal terminal arbors. In the auditory system, endogenously released ATP in the cochlea activates inner hair cells to trigger bursts of action potentials (APs), which are transferred to the central auditory system. Here we show the modulatory role of purinergic signaling beyond the cochlea, i.e., the developmentally regulated and cell-type-specific depolarizing effects on auditory brainstem neurons of Mongolian gerbil. We assessed the effects of P2X receptors (P2XRs) on neuronal excitability from prehearing to early stages of auditory signal processing. Our results demonstrate that in neurons expressing P2XRs, extracellular ATP can evoke APs in sync with Ca 2 + signals. In cochlear nucleus (CN) bushy cells, ATP increases spontaneous and also acoustically evoked activity in vivo, but these effects diminish with maturity. Moreover, ATP not only augmented glutamate-driven firing, but it also evoked APs in the absence of glutamatergic transmission. In vivo recordings also revealed that endogenously released ATP in the CN contributes to neuronal firing activity by facilitating AP generation and prolonging AP duration. Given the enhancing effect of ATP on AP firing and confinement of P2XRs to certain auditory brainstem nuclei, and to distinct neurons within these nuclei, it is conceivable that purinergic signaling plays a specific role in the development of neuronal brainstem circuits. © 2012 the authors.},

We used the good signal-to-noise ratio of juxtacellular recordings to dissect the intrinsic and network mechanisms controlling the input-output relationship of SBCs in anesthetized gerbils. The SBCs generally operated close to action potential (AP) threshold and showed no evidence for synaptic depression, suggesting that the endbulbs of Held have low release probability in vivo. Analysis of the complex waveforms suggested that in the absence of auditory stimulation, postsynaptic spike depression and stochastic fluctuations in EPSP size were the main factors determining jitter and reliability of the endbulb synapse. During auditory stimulation, progressively larger EPSPs were needed to trigger APs at increasing sound intensities. Simulations suggested hyperpolarizing inhibition could explain the observed decrease in EPSP efficacy. Synaptic inhibition showed a delayed onset and generally had a higher threshold than excitatory inputs, but otherwise inhibition and excitation showed mostly overlapping frequency-response areas. The recruitment of synaptic inhibition caused postsynaptic spikes to be preferentially triggered by well-timed, large EPSPs, resulting in improved phase locking despite more variable EPSP-AP latencies. Our results suggest that the lack of synaptic depression, caused by low release probability, and the apparent absence of sound-evoked synaptic inhibition at low sound intensity maximize sensitivity of SBCs. At higher sound intensities, the recruitment of synaptic inhibition constrains their firing rate and optimizes their temporal precision.},

	abstract = {Our sense of hearing depends on precisely organized circuits that allow us to sense, perceive, and respond to complex sounds in our environment, from music and language to simple warning signals. Auditory processing begins in the cochlea of the inner ear, where sounds are detected by sensory hair cells and then transmitted to the central nervous system by spiral ganglion neurons, which faithfully preserve the frequency, intensity, and timing of each stimulus. During the assembly of auditory circuits, spiral ganglion neurons establish precise connections that link hair cells in the cochlea to target neurons in the auditory brainstem, develop specific firing properties, and elaborate unusual synapses both in the periphery and in the CNS. Understanding how spiral ganglion neurons acquire these unique properties is a key goal in auditory neuroscience, as these neurons represent the sole input of auditory information to the brain. In addition, the best currently available treatment for many forms of deafness is the cochlear implant, which compensates for lost hair cell function by directly stimulating the auditory nerve. Historically, studies of the auditory system have lagged behind other sensory systems due to the small size and inaccessibility of the inner ear. With the advent of new molecular genetic tools, this gap is narrowing. Here, we summarize recent insights into the cellular and molecular cues that guide the development of spiral ganglion neurons, from their origin in the proneurosensory domain of the otic vesicle to the formation of specialized synapses that ensure rapid and reliable transmission of sound information from the ear to the brain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Discharge patterns of the majority of units resembled those seen in previous studies when recordings were made from regions of the cochlear nucleus which are known to contribute fibers to the striae. Some patterns, however, were unlike any which have been reported in the cochlear nucleus on the same side as the recording site, but resembled activity of other auditory structures, suggesting that these were descending inputs. To confirm the presence of descending activity, recordings were made in the dorsal acoustic stria at a point medial to where the stria had been completely severed. Recordings made under these conditions demonstrated the presence of descending activity. The physiological findings help explain the disparity between the counts of fibers and cells, and point out a need for more detailed descriptions of the origins of descending inputs through the striae.},

The basic idea of this model is that the auditory system attempts to eliminate the masking components by first transforming the stimuli presented to the two ears so as to equalize the two masking components, and then subtracting. In order to obtain results that are quantitatively realistic, this processing is assumed to be corrupted by various types of errors. The model is applied to data in which the signal to be detected consists of a pulsed tone, the masking signal consists of loud, broad‐band, Gaussian noise, and the only differences between the stimuli presented to the two ears are those of time delay or amplitude (the interaural amplitude ratios being restricted to unity or zero). The results indicate that the ability of the auditory. system to control interaural intensity ratios and interaural time delays is limited to accuracies of about 1 dB and 150 μsec and that the auditory system has difficulty in compensating for interaural time delays greater than the time it takes for sound to travel a distance equal to the width of the head.},

Using intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase, the present study analyzes the projections of these three neuronal subclasses to the various subdivisions of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and to the different cell types found therein. The average number of swellings and number of cells contacted decreased from low- to medium- to high-SR groups. However, these differences in terminal elaboration were not evenly distributed throughout the AVCN. The small cell cap was almost exclusively innervated by low- and medium-SR fibers, i.e., those with the highest acoustic thresholds. Within anterior AVCN, spherical-cell innervation was seen from all SR groups, whereas almost all multipolar cell innervation was from low- and medium-SR fibers. In the posterior AVCN, multipolar-cell innervation was equally likely from all SR groups, whereas globular cells were preferentially contacted by high-SR fibers. These SR-based trends in cochlear nucleus innervation help explain some of the known physiological properties of cell-types in each subdivision. They also suggest that additional physiological study of the small cell cap may be key in elucidating the functional significance of the low-SR population.},

CS axons head into the trapezoid body, while OC axons use the intermediate acoustic stria of Held. At the electron microscopic (EM) level, collateral terminals of OC axons contain pleomorphic vesicles; CS terminals contain small round vesicles. CS dendritic trees tend to be distributed in a stellate fashion while OC dendritic trees tend to be elongated. At the EM level the sustained chopper somata are sparsely innervated while the proximal dendritic tree receives considerably more input. The OC somata are highly innervated and this heavy innervation continues out onto the proximal dendrites. Distally the dendritic innervation falls off considerably for both categories. Physiologically, members of the OC population have wider dynamic ranges at the characteristic frequency (CF), wider response areas that are typically not flanked by inhibitory sidebands, and responses to short tones that do not show the same form of regularity expressed by sustained choppers. Intracellularly the sustained choppers exhibit sustained depolarization to short tones for the duration of the stimulus with resultant regular spiking at a rate that is stimulus level dependent. The response to swept tone shows this same level-dependent regularity. In response to tones, the OC cells also show a sustained depolarization whose amplitude is stimulus-level dependent but whose range is much greater and whose onset is initiated more abruptly. Although the onset component of the OC spike output is reliably initiated by these levels of depolarization, regular firing to the sustained depolarization is not initiated at levels of depolarization that would surely generate regular firing in sustained choppers. This regularity is also absent in the swept tone response despite marked levels of excitation.},

In general, the morphology of cells labeled intracellularly with HRP corresponded to those made with Golgi impregnations in mice and other mammals. The following cells were labeled: one granule cell, four cartwheel cells, eight fusiform cells, two other cells in the fusiform cell layer, and two tuberculoventral association cells in the deep layers of the DCN. The axon of the granule cell runs parallel to isofrequency laminae with collaterals branching perpendicularly and running along the tonotopic axis. The cartwheel cells have dendrites in the molecular layer that are densely covered with spines. The axon of one cell terminates just dorsally to the cell body. Fusiform cells have the characteristic spiny, apical and smooth, basal dendrites. The basal dendrites are conspicuously oriented parallel to isofrequency laminae. Axons of the fusiform cells exit through the dorsal acoustic stria without branching. The two tuberculoventral association cells in the deep DCN have axons that terminate both in the deep DCN, within the same isofrequency lamina that contains the cell body, and in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). Intracellular recordings from 11 of these cells show that they cannot be distinguished on the basis of their responses to intracellularly injected current. All cell types fired large action potentials that were followed by a fast and a slower undershoot, distinguishing them from cells of the VCN but not from one another. Most cells responded to shocks of the auditory nerve root with early EPSPs and later IPSPs. The latencies of EPSPs show that some were monosynaptic and others polysynaptic. That there was no systematic relationship between the latencies of EPSPs and the cell types from which they were recorded shows that shocks to the nerve root may have activated more than just the large, myelinated, auditory nerve fibers.},

	volume = {60},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {1. The responses of neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of decerebrate cats are described with regard to their regularity of discharge and latency. Regularity is measured by estimating the mean and standard deviation of interspike intervals as a function of time during responses to short tone bursts (25 ms). This method extends the usual interspike-interval analysis based on interval histograms by allowing the study of temporal changes in regularity during transient responses. The coefficient of variation (CV), equal to the ratio of standard deviation to mean interspike interval, is used as a measure of irregularity. Latency is measured as the mean and standard deviation of the latency of the first spike in response to short tone bursts, with 1.6-ms rise times. 2. The regularity and latency properties of the usual PST histogram response types are shown. Five major PST response type classes are used: chopper, primary-like, onset, onset-C, and unusual. The presence of a prepotential in a unit's action potentials is also noted; a prepotential implies that the unit is recorded from a bushy cell. 3. Units with chopper PST histograms give the most regular discharge. Three varieties of choppers are found. Chop-S units (regular choppers) have CVs less than 0.35 that are approximately constant during the response; chop-S units show no adaptation of instantaneous rate, as measured by the inverse of the mean interspike interval. Chop-T units have CVs greater than 0.35, show an increase in irregularity during the response and show substantial rate adaptation. Chop-U units have CVs greater than 0.35, show a decrease in irregularity during the response, and show a variety of rate adaptation behaviors, including negative adaptation (an increase in rate during a short-tone response). Irregular choppers (chop-T and chop-U units) rarely have CVs greater than 0.5. Choppers have the longest latencies of VCN units; all three groups have mean latencies at least 1 ms longer than the shortest auditory nerve (AN) fiber mean latencies. 4. Chopper units are recorded from stellate cells in VCN (35, 42). Our results for chopper units suggest a model for stellate cells in which a regularly firing action potential generator is driven by the summation of the AN inputs to the cell, where the summation is low-pass filtered by the membrane capacitance of the cell.},

The total number of branch points was correlated with total fiber length, a relationship that remained relatively constant when analyzing the ascending and descending branches together or separately. On the other hand, the ascending branches of four out of five fibers having CFs below 0.5 kHz bifurcated and gave rise to a pair of terminal endbulbs of Held. Low- and medium-SR fibers gave rise to more endings than did high-SR fibers, especially on the ascending branch. This difference was accounted for by small endings, a category composed of terminal boutons, string endings, and small complex endings. The categories of modified endbulbs, and endbulbs of Held did not vary in number with respect to fiber SR. The mean area of each ending type within the small ending category was statistically smaller for low- and medium-SR fibers than for high-SR fibers, whereas the mean area of modified endbulbs and endbulbs of Held was not correlated with fiber SR. Total ending area per fiber appeared independent of either CF or SR. These results are discussed in relation to issues of conservation of axon arborizations and terminals, and convergence of input from the different SR groups.},

	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {Physiological response properties of neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus have a variety of features that are substantially different from the stereotypical auditory nerve responses that serve as the principal source of activation for these neurons. These emergent features are the result of the varying distribution of auditory nerve inputs on the soma and dendrites of the various cell types within the nucleus; the intrinsic membrane characteristics of the various cell types causing different responses to the same input in different cell types; and secondary excitatory and inhibitory inputs to different cell types. Well-isolated units were recorded with high-impedance glass microelectrodes, both intracellularly and extracellularly. Units were characterized by their temporal response to short tones, rate vs. intensity relation, and response areas. The principal response patterns were onset, chopper, and primary-like. Onset units are characterized by a well-timed first spike in response to tones at the characteristic frequency. For frequencies less than 1 kHz, onset units can entrain to the stimulus frequency with greater precision than their auditory nerve inputs. This implies that onset units receive converging inputs from a number of auditory nerve fibers. Onset units are divided into three subcategories, OC, OL, and OI. OC units have extraordinarily wide dynamic ranges and low-frequency selectivity. Some are capable of sustaining firing rates of 800 spikes/s at high intensities. They have the smallest standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the first spike latency of any cells in the cochlear nuclei. OC units are candidates for encoding intensity. OI and OL units differ from OC units in that they have dynamic ranges and frequency selectivity ranges much like those of auditory nerve fibers. They differ from one another in their steady-state firing rates; OI units fire mainly at the onset of a tone. OI units also differ from OL units in that they prefer frequency sweeps in the low to high direction. Primary-like-with-notch (PLN) units also respond to tones with a well-timed first spike. They differ from onset cells in that the onset peak is not always as precise as the spontaneous rate is higher. A comparison of spontaneous firing rate and saturation firing rate of PLN units with auditory nerve fibers suggest that PLN units receive one to four auditory nerve fiber inputs. Chopper units fire in a sustained regular manner when they are excited by sound.},

	abstract = {1. The amino acid neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine function as inhibitory neurotransmitters associated with nonprimary inputs onto spherical bushy and stellate cells, two principal cell types located in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). These neurons are characterized by primary-like (including phase-locked) and chopper temporal response patterns, respectively. 2. Inhibition directly adjacent to the excitatory response area has been hypothesized to sharpen or limit the breadth of the tonal frequency receptive field. This study was undertaken to test whether GABA and glycine circuits function primarily to sharpen the lateral edges of the tonal excitatory response area or to modulate discharge rate within central portions of the excitatory response area of AVCN neurons. 3. To test this, iontophoretic application of the glycineI antagonist, strychnine, or the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, was used to block inhibitory inputs after obtaining control families of isointensity contours (response areas) from extracellularly recorded AVCN neurons. 4. Blockade of GABA and/or glycine inputs was found to increase discharge rate primarily within the excitatory response area of neurons displaying chopper and primary-like temporal responses with little or no change in bandwidth or in off-characteristic frequency (CF) discharge rate. 5. The principal sources of inhibitory inputs onto AVCN neurons are cells located in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex, which appear to be tonotopically matched to their targets. In agreement with these morphological studies, the data presented in this paper suggest that most GABA and/or glycine inhibition is tonotopically aligned with excitatory inputs. 6. These findings support models that suggest that GABA and/or glycine inputs onto AVCN neurons are involved in circuits that adjust gain to enable the detection of signals in noise by enhancing signal relative to background.},

	abstract = {This report focuses on a class of large synaptic endings, the endbulbs of Held. These endings are located in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus and arise from the axons of type I spiral ganglion neurons. Axons were stained with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using intracellular injections of single fibers or extracellular injections into the auditory nerve. Individual endbulbs or pairs of endbulbs that converged onto the same spherical bushy cell were examined with the aid of a light microscope and subjected to morphometric analyses. Endbulbs of fibers having low spontaneous discharge rates (SR, less than or equal to 18 spikes/sec) have a more complex shape than those of high SR fibers (greater than 18 s/s), a feature represented by systematic differences in endbulb silhouette perimeter without differences in endbulb silhouette area. Consequently, the ratio, silhouette area divided by silhouette perimeter, yields a "form factor" separating endbulbs of high SR from those of low SR. High SR fibers had ratios greater than 0.52 (mean = 0.63 +/- 0.09), whereas low SR fibers had ratios less than 0.52 (mean = 0.45 +/- 0.06). Pairs of endbulbs with unknown physiological properties had similar form factor values, despite the wide range of values observed in the endbulb population. These data imply that endbulbs converging upon the cell body of a spherical bushy cell arise from fibers of the same SR group. Electron microscopic examination was conducted on the endbulb of one physiologically characterized and intracellularly stained auditory nerve fiber (CF = 1.4 kHz; SR = 55 s/s) and its unstained endbulb mate with the aid of serial ultrathin sections. In addition to the well-known axosomatic synapses, these endbulbs formed axodendritic synapses: 11.7\% for the HRP-labeled endbulb and 13.3\% for the unlabeled endbulb. The axodendritic synapses appear to occur on dendrites of nearby spherical bushy cells and may represent a mechanism whereby single endbulbs can disperse activity to multiple neurons in the cochlear nucleus. We propose that axosomatic synapses preserve fiber SR groupings, whereas axodendritic synapses may not.},

This system forms a collection of parallel pathways that diverge at the first auditory synapse in the brainstem, in the cochlear nucleus (CN), and then converge again, at least in a gross anatomical sense, in the inferior colliculus (for abbreviations, see Table 5.1). The CN is a well-studied collection of neural circuits that are diverse both in anatomical and physiological terms (reviewed by Cant 1992; Rhode and Greenberg 1992; Young 1998). These vary from the simplest system, the bushy cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN; see Yin, Chapter 4), to the most complex, in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). The DCN differs from other parts of the CN by having an extensive internal neuropil formed by groups of interneurons (Lorente de Nô 1981; Osen et al. 1990). As a result, the DCN makes significant changes in the auditory representation from its inputs to its outputs. In this chapter, the neural organization of the DCN is reviewed, paying most attention to data from the cat. The response properties of DCN neurons are discussed in the context of its neural organization and related to data on the functional role of the DCN in hearing.},

	abstract = {1. Convergence of auditory nerve (AN) fibers onto bushy cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) was investigated with a model that describes the electrical membrane properties of these cells. The model consists of a single compartment, representing the soma, and includes three voltage-sensitive ion channels (fast sodium, delayed-rectifier-like potassium, and low-threshold potassium). These three channels have characteristics derived from voltage clamp data of VCN bushy cells. The model also contains a leakage channel, membrane capacitance, and synaptic inputs. The model accurately reproduces the membrane rectification seen in current clamp studies of bushy cells, as well as their unique current clamp responses. 2. In this study, the number and synaptic strength of excitatory AN inputs to the model were varied to investigate the relationship between input convergence parameters and response characteristics. From 1 to 20 excitatory synaptic inputs were applied through channels in parallel with the voltage-gated channels. Each synapse was driven by an independent AN spike train; spike arrivals produced brief (approximately 0.5 ms) conductance increases. The number (NS) and conductance (AE) of these inputs were systematically varied. The input spike trains were generated as a renewal point process that accurately models characteristics of AN fibers (refractoriness, adaptation, onset latency, irregularity of discharge, and phase locking). Adaptation characteristics of both high and low spontaneous rate (SR) AN fibers were simulated. 3. As NS and AE vary over the ranges 1-20 and 3-80 nS, respectively, the full range of response types seen in VCN bushy cells are produced by the model, with AN inputs typical of high-SR AN fibers. These include primarylike (PL), primarylike-with-notch (Pri-N), and onset-L (On-L). In addition, Onset responses, whose association with bushy cells in uncertain, and "dip" responses, which are not seen in the VCN, are produced. Dip responses occur with large NS and/or AE, and are due to depolarization block. When the AN inputs have the adaptation characteristics of low-SR AN fibers, PL--but not Pri-N or On-L responses--are produced. This suggests that neurons showing Pri-N and On-L responses must receive high-SR AN inputs. 4. The regularity of discharge of the model is compared with that of VCN bushy cells, using a measure derived from the mean and standard deviation of interspike intervals. Regularity is an important constraint on the model because the regularity of VCN bushy cells is the same as that of their AN inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {This paper will review some of the functional changes that occur in the central auditory pathway after the cochlea is damaged by acoustic overstimulation or by carboplatin, an ototoxic drug that selectively destroys inner hair cells (IHCs) in the chinchilla. Acoustic trauma typically impairs the sensitivity and tuning of auditory nerve fibers and reduces the neural output of the cochlea. Surprisingly, our results show that restricted cochlear damage enhances neural activity in the central auditory pathway. Despite a reduction in the auditory-nerve compound action potential (CAP), the local field potential from the inferior colliculus (IC) increases at a faster than normal rate and its maximum amplitude is enhanced at frequencies below the region of hearing loss. To determine if this enhancement was due to loss of sideband inhibition, we recorded from single neurons in the IC and dorsal cochlear nucleus before and after presenting a traumatizing above the unit's characteristic frequency (CF). Following the exposure, some neurons showed substantial broadening of tuning below CF, less inhibition, and a significant increase in discharge rate, consistent with a model involving loss of sideband inhibition. The central auditory system of the chinchilla can be deprived of some of its cochlear inputs by selectively destroying IHCs with carboplatin. Selective IHC loss reduces the amplitude of the CAP without affecting the threshold and tuning of the remaining auditory nerve fibers. Although the output of the cochlea is reduced in proportion to the amount of IHC loss, the IC response shows only a modest amplitude reduction, and remarkably, the response of the auditory cortex is enhanced. These results suggest that the gain of the central auditory pathway can be up- or down regulated to compensate for the amount of neural activity from the cochlea. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Intracellular responses of onset chopper neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus to tones: evidence for dual-component processing. The ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) contains a heterogeneous collection of cell types reflecting the multiple processing tasks undertaken by this nucleus. This in vivo study in the rat used intracellular recordings and dye filling to examine membrane potential changes and firing characteristics of onset chopper (OC) neurons to acoustic stimulation (50 ms pure tones, 5 ms r/f time). Stable impalements were made from 15 OC neurons, 7 identified as multipolar cells. Neurons responded to characteristic frequency (CF) tones with sustained depolarization below spike threshold. With increasing stimulus intensity, the depolarization during the initial 10 ms of the response became peaked, and with further increases in intensity the peak became narrower. Onset spikes were generated during this initial depolarization. Tones presented below CF resulted in a broadening of this initial depolarizing component with high stimulus intensities required to initiate onset spikes. This initial component was followed by a sustained depolarizing component lasting until stimulus cessation. The amplitude of the sustained depolarizing component was greatest when frequencies were presented at high intensities below CF resulting in increased action potential firing during this period when compared with comparable high intensities at CF. During the presentation of tones at or above the high-frequency edge of a cell's response area, hyperpolarization was evident during the sustained component. The presence of hyperpolarization and the differences seen in the level of sustained depolarization during CF and off CF tones suggests that changes in membrane responsiveness between the initial and sustained components may be attributed to polysynaptic inhibitory mechanisms. The dual-component processing resulting from convergent auditory nerve excitation and polysynaptic inhibition enables OC neurons to respond in a unique fashion to intensity and frequency features contained within an acoustic stimulus.},

Seventeen adult cats were used: four had normal hearing; 12 were deafened neonatally for periods of {\textless} 2.5 years (five bilaterally, seven unilaterally); and one animal had a long-term (approximately 8 years) profound bilateral hearing loss. Bipolar scala tympani stimulating electrodes were bilaterally implanted in each animal, and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs) were recorded in an acute study to evaluate the basic physiologic response properties of the deafened auditory pathway. The cochleae and cochlear nuclei (CN) of each animal were examined with light microscopy. Spiral ganglion cell density in neonatally deafened cochleae was 17\% of normal, and only 1.5\% of normal in the long-term deaf animal. There was a 46\% reduction in total CN volume in neonatally deafened animals compared to normal, and a 60\% reduction in the long-term deaf animal. Neural density in the anteroventral CN of bilaterally deafened animals was 37\% higher than normal; 44\% higher in the long-term deaf animal. Significantly, however, we saw no evidence of a loss of neurones within the anteroventral CN in any deafened animal. There was a significant increase in EABR threshold and wave IV latency in the deafened animals, and a significant decrease in response amplitude and input/output function gradient. Again, these changes were more extensive in the long-term deaf animal. These data show that a sensorineural hearing loss can evoke significant morphological and physiological changes within the cochlea and auditory brainstem, and these changes become greater with duration of deafness. It remains to be seen whether these changes can be reversed following the introduction of afferent activity via chronic electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between different brainstem cell populations and the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP). First, we present a mathematical model relating the BAEP to underlying cellular activity. Then, we identify specific cellular generators of the click-evoked BAEP in cats by combining model-derived insights with key experimental data. These data include (a) a correspondence between particular brainstem regions and specific extrema in the BAEP waveform, determined from lesion experiments, and (b) values for model parameters derived from published physiological and anatomical information. Ultimately, we conclude (with varying degrees of confidence) that: (1) the earliest extrema in the BAEP are generated by spiral ganglion cells, (2) P2 is mainly generated by cochlear nucleus (CN) globular cells, (3) P3 is partly generated by CN spherical cells and partly by cells receiving inputs from globular cells, (4) P4 is predominantly generated by medial superior olive (MSO) principal cells, which are driven by spherical cells, (5) the generators of P5 are driven by MSO principal cells, and (6) the BAEP, as a whole, is generated mainly by cells with characteristic frequencies above 2 kHz. Thus, the BAEP in cats mainly reflects cellular activity in two parallel pathways, one originating with globular cells and the other with spherical cells. Since the globular cell pathway is poorly represented in humans, we suggest that the human BAEP is largely generated by brainstem cells in the spherical cell pathway. Given our conclusions, it should now be possible to relate activity in specific cell populations to psychophysical performance since the BAEP can be recorded in behaving humans and animals.},

	doi = {10.1097/AUD.0000000000000126},
	abstract = {Objectives—The primary aim of this study was to compare the perceptual sensation produced by bipolar electrical stimulation of auditory brainstem implant (ABI) electrodes to the morphology of electrically–evoked responses elicited by the same bipolar stimulus in the same unanesthetized, post-surgical state. Secondary aims were to 1) examine the relationships between sensations elicited by the bipolar stimulation used for evoked potential recording and the sensations elicited by the monopolar pulse-train stimulation used by the implant processor and 2) to examine the relationships between evoked-potential morphology (elicited by bipolar stimulation) to the sensations elicited by monopolar stimulation. Design—Electrically-evoked early latency and middle-latency responses to bipolar, biphasic low-rate pulses were recorded post-operatively in four adults with auditory brainstem implants. Prior to recording, the perceptual sensations elicited by these bipolar stimuli were obtained and categorized as: 1) Auditory sensations only, 2) Mixed sensations (both auditory and non-auditory), 3) Side Effect (non-auditory sensations) or 4) No Sensation. In addition, the sensations elicited by monopolar higher-rate pulse-train stimuli similar to that used in processor programming were also measured for all electrodes in the ABI array and classified using the same categories. Comparisons were made between evoked response morphology, bipolar stimulation sensation and monopolar stimulation sensation. Results—Sensations were classified for 33 bipolar pairs as follows: 21 pairs were Auditory, 6 were Mixed, 5 were Side Effect and 1 was No Sensation. When these sensations were compared to the electrically-evoked response morphology for these signals, P3 of the electrically-evoked auditory brainstem response (eABR) and the presence of a middle-latency positive wave, usually between 15 and 25 ms (eMLR), were only present when the perceptual sensation had an auditory component (either Auditory or Mixed pairs). The presence of other waves in the early-latency response such as N1 or P2 or a positive wave after 4 ms did not distinguish between only auditory or only non-auditory sensations. For monopolar stimulation, 42 were classified as Auditory, 16 were Mixed and 26 were classified as Side Effect or No Sensation. When bipolar sensations were compared to monopolar sensations for the 21 bipolar pairs categorized as Auditory, 7 pairs had monopolar sensations of Auditory for both electrodes, 9 pairs had only one electrode with a monopolar sensation of Auditory, with the remainder having neither electrode as Auditory. Of 6 bipolar pairs categorized as Mixed, 3 had monopolar auditory sensations for one of the electrodes. When monopolar stimulation was compared to evoked potential morphology elicited by bipolar stimulation, P3 and the eMLR were more likely to be present when one or both of the electrodes in the bipolar pair elicited an Auditory or Mixed sensation with monopolar stimulation and were less likely to occur when neither of the electrodes had an auditory monopolar sensation. Again, other eABR waves did not distinguish between auditory and non-auditory sensations. Conclusions—ABI electrodes that are associated with auditory sensations elicited by bipolar stimulation are more likely to elicit evoked responses with a P3 wave and/or a middle-latency wave. P3 of the eABR and M15-25 of the eMLR are less likely to be present if neither electrode of the bipolar pair evoked an auditory sensation with monopolar stimulation},

A new generation ABI based on optogenetic-technology may ameliorate limitations fundamental to electrical neurostimulation. The most widely studied opsin is channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2); however, its relatively slow kinetic properties may prevent the encoding of auditory information at high stimulation rates. In the present study, we compare the temporal resolution of light-evoked responses of a recently developed fast opsin, Chronos, to ChR2 in a murine ABI model. Viral mediated gene transfer via a posterolateral craniotomy was used to express Chronos or ChR2 in the mouse nucleus (CN). Following a four to six week incubation period, blue light (473 nm) was delivered via an optical fiber placed directly on the surface of the infected CN, and neural activity was recorded in the contralateral inferior colliculus (IC). Both ChR2 and Chronos evoked sustained responses to all stimuli, even at high driven rates. In addition, optical stimulation evoked excitatory responses throughout the tonotopic axis of the IC. Synchrony of the light- evoked response to stimulus rates of 14–448 pulses/s was higher in Chronos compared to ChR2 mice (p{\textless}0.05 at 56, 168, and 224 pulses/s). Our results demonstrate that Chronos has the ability to drive the auditory system at higher stimulation rates than ChR2 and may be a more ideal opsin for manipulation of auditory pathways in future optogenetic-based neuroprostheses.},

	abstract = {Spherical bushy cells (SBCs) in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus respond to acoustic stimulation with discharges that precisely encode the phase of low-frequency sound. The accuracy of spiking is crucial for sound localization and speech perception. Compared to the auditory nerve input, temporal precision of SBC spiking is improved through the engagement of acoustically evoked inhibition. Recently, the inhibition was shown to be less precise than previously understood. It shifts from predominantly glycinergic to synergistic GABA/glycine transmission in an activity-dependent manner. Concurrently, the inhibition attains a tonic character through temporal summation. The present study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying this slow inhibitory input. We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings on SBCs from juvenile Mongolian gerbils and recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at physiological rates. The data reveal activity-dependent IPSC kinetics, i.e. the decay is slowed with increased input rates or recruitment. Lowering the release probability yielded faster decay kinetics of the single- and short train-IPSCs at 100Hz, suggesting that transmitter quantity plays an important role in controlling the decay. Slow transmitter clearance from the synaptic cleft caused prolonged receptor binding and, in the case of glycine, spillover to nearby synapses. The GABAergic component prolonged the decay by contributing to the asynchronous vesicle release depending on the input rate. Hence, the different factors controlling the amount of transmitters in the synapse jointly slow the inhibition during physiologically relevant activity. Taken together, the slow time course is predominantly determined by the receptor kinetics and transmitter clearance during short stimuli, whereas long duration or high frequency stimulation additionally engage asynchronous release to prolong IPSCs.},

Although the local circuits within the cochlear nuclei are understood at a cellular level, the spatial patterns of connectivity and the connection strengths in these circuits have been less well characterized. We have applied a novel, quantitative approach to mapping local circuits projecting to cells in the mouse anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) using laser-scanning photostimulation and glutamate uncaging. The amplitude and kinetics of individual evoked synaptic events were measured to reveal the patterns and strengths of synaptic connections. We found that the two major excitatory projection cell classes, the bushy and T-stellate cells, receive a spatially broad inhibition from D-stellate cells in the AVCN, and a spatially confined inhibition from the tuberculoventral cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Furthermore, T-stellate cells integrate D-stellate inhibition from an area that spans twice the frequency range of that integrated by bushy cells. A subset of both bushy and T-stellate cells receives inhibition from an unidentified cell population at the dorsal-medial boundary of the AVCN. A smaller subset of cells receives local excitation from within the AVCN. Our results show that inhibitory circuits can have target-specific patterns of spatial convergence, synaptic strength, and receptor kinetics, resulting in different spectral and temporal processing capabilities.},

The auditory brainstem nuclei process this temporal information through parallel pathways that originate in the cochlear nucleus from different classes of cells. Although the roles of ion channels and excitatory synapses in temporal processing have been well studied, the contribution of inhibition is less well understood. Here, we show in CBA/CaJ mice that the two major projection neurons of the ventral cochlear nucleus, the bushy and T-stellate cells, receive glycinergic inhibition with different synaptic conductance time courses. Bushy cells, which provide precisely timed spike trains used in sound localization and pitch identification, receive slow inhibitory inputs. In contrast, T-stellate cells, which encode slower envelope information, receive inhibition that is eightfold faster. Both types of inhibition improved the precision of spike timing but engage different cellular mechanisms and operate on different timescales. Computer models reveal that slow IPSCs in bushy cells can improve spike timing on the scale of tens of microseconds. Although fast and slow IPSCs in T-stellate cells improve spike timing on the scale of milliseconds, only fast IPSCs can enhance the detection of narrowband acoustic signals in a complex background. Our results suggest that target-specific IPSC kinetics are critical for the segregated parallel processing of temporal information from the sensory environment.},

	abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

But how is auditory cortex organization affected by congenital, prelingual, and long standing deafness? Does the large-scale topographical organization of the auditory cortex develop in people deaf from birth? And is it retained despite cross-modal plasticity? We identified, using fMRI, topographic tonotopy-based functional connectivity (FC) structure in humans in the core auditory cortex, its extending tonotopic gradients in the belt and even beyond that. These regions show similar FC structure in the congenitally deaf throughout the auditory cortex, including in the language areas. The topographic FC pattern can be identified reliably in the vast majority of the deaf, at the single subject level, despite the absence of hearing-aid use and poor oral language skills. These findings suggest that large-scale tonotopic-based FC does not require sensory experience to develop, and is retained despite life-long auditory deprivation and cross-modal plasticity. Furthermore, as the topographic FC is retained to varying degrees among the deaf subjects, it may serve to predict the potential for auditory rehabilitation using cochlear implants in individual subjects.},

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental formation of this precise organization remain not well understood. Here, we report in the developing mouse cochlea that deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) contributes to the proper organization of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) within the Rosenthal's canal and of SGN projections toward both the peripheral and central auditory targets. In Dcc mutant embryos, mispositioning of SGNs occurred along the peripheral auditory pathway with misrouted afferent fibers and reduced synaptic contacts with hair cells. The central auditory pathway simultaneously exhibited similar defective phenotypes as in the periphery with abnormal exit of SGNs from the Rosenthal's canal towards central nuclei. Furthermore, the axons of SGNs ascending into the cochlear nucleus had disrupted bifurcation patterns. Thus, Dcc is necessary for establishing the proper spatial organization of SGNs and their fibers in both peripheral and central auditory pathways, through controlling axon targeting and cell migration. Our results suggest that Dcc plays an important role in the developmental formation of peripheral and central auditory circuits, and its mutation may contribute to sensorineural hearing loss.},

In the auditory system, inhibition already modulates second order neurons in the cochlear nucleus, e.g. spherical bushy cells (SBCs). While the physiological basis of inhibition and excitation is well described, their functional interaction in signal processing remains elusive. Using a combination of in vivo loose-patch recordings, iontophoretic drug application, and detailed signal analysis in the Mongolian Gerbil, we demonstrate that inhibition is widely co-tuned with excitation, and leads only to minor sharpening of the spectral response properties. Combinations of complex stimuli and neuronal input-output analysis based on spectrotemporal receptive fields revealed inhibition to render the neuronal output temporally sparser and more reproducible than the input. Overall, inhibition plays a central role in preserving or even improving temporal response fidelity of SBCs across a wide range of input intensities and thereby provides the basis for high-fidelity signal processing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND—Arterial ischemic stroke occurs most frequently in term newborns than in the elderly, and brain immaturity affects mechanisms of ischemic injury and recovery. The susceptibility to injury of the brain was assumed to be lower in the perinatal period as compared to childhood. This concept was recently challenged by clinical studies showing marked motor disabilities after stroke in neonates, with the severity of motor and cortical sensory deficits similar in both perinatal and childhood ischemic stroke. The understanding of the triggers and the pathophysiological mechanisms of perinatal stroke has greatly improved in recent years, but many aspects remain still unclear. METHODS—In this review, we will focus on the pathophysiology of perinatal stroke and on therapeutic strategies that can protect the immature brain from the consequences of stroke by targeting inflammation and brain microenvironment. RESULTS—Studies in neonatal rodent models of cerebral ischemia have shown a potential role for soluble inflammatory molecules as important modulators of injury and recovery. A great effort has been made and is still in act to try neuroprotective molecules based on the new physiopatological acquisition.},

This unique neuronal network is organized in several afferent-efferent feedback loops including: the (i) colliculo-thalamic-cortico-collicular; (ii) cortico-(collicular)-OC; and (iii) cortico-(collicular)-CN pathways. Recent experiments demonstrate that blocking ongoing auditory-cortex activity with pharmacological and physical methods modulates the amplitude of cochlear potentials. In addition, auditory-cortex microstimulation independently modulates cochlear sensitivity and the strength of the OC reflex. In this mini-review, anatomical and physiological evidence supporting the presence of a functional efferent network from the auditory cortex to the cochlear receptor is presented. Special emphasis is given to the corticofugal effects on initial auditory processing, that is, on CN, auditory nerve and cochlear responses. A working model of three parallel pathways from the auditory cortex to the cochlea and auditory nerve is proposed.},

	abstract = {Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) restore hearing to deaf individuals not eligible for cochlear implants. Speech comprehension in ABI users is generally poor compared to that of cochlear implant users, and side effects are common. The poor performance may result from activating broad areas and multiple neuronal populations of the cochlear nucleus, however detailed studies of the responses to surface stimulation of the cochlear nucleus are lacking. A conformable electrode array was microfabricated to fit on the rat's dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). It hosts 20 small electrodes (each 100 μm diam.). The array was tested by recording evoked potentials and neural activity along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus (IC). Almost all bipolar electrode pairs elicited responses, in some cases with an even, or relatively constant, pattern of thresholds and supra-threshold measures along the long axis of the array. This pattern suggests that conformable arrays can provide relatively constant excitation along the surface of the DCN and thus might decrease the ABI side effects caused by spread of high current to adjacent structures. We also examined tonotopic patterns of the IC responses. Compared to sound-evoked responses, electrically-evoked response mappings had less tonotopic organization and were broader in width. They became more tonotopic when the evoked activity common to all electrodes and the late phase of response were subtracted out, perhaps because the remaining activity is from tonotopically organized principal cells of the DCN. Responses became less tonotopic when inter-electrode distance was increased from 400 μm to 800 μm but were relatively unaffected by changing to monopolar stimulation. The results illustrate the challenges of using a surface array to present tonotopic cues and improve speech comprehension in humans who use the ABI.},

We report results from experiments in which the gerbil auditory system was stimulated by optical radiation, acoustic tones, or electric current. Immunohistochemical staining for the protein c-FOS revealed the spread of excitation. We demonstrate a spatially selective activation of neurons using a laser; only neurons in the direct optical path are stimulated. This pattern of c-FOS labeling is in contrast to that after electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation leads to a large, more spatially extended population of labeled, activated neurons. In the auditory system, optical stimulation of nerves could have a significant impact on the performance of cochlear implants, which can be limited by the electric current spread.},

	abstract = {Tonotopy is a fundamental organizational feature of the auditory system. Sounds are encoded by the spatial and temporal patterns of electrical activity in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and are transmitted via tonotopically ordered processes from the cochlea through the eighth nerve to the cochlear nuclei. Upon reaching the brainstem, SGN axons bifurcate in a stereotyped pattern, innervating target neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (aVCN) with one branch and in the posteroventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei (pVCN and DCN) with the other. Each branch is tonotopically organized, thereby distributing acoustic information systematically along multiple parallel pathways for processing in the brainstem. In mice with a mutation in the receptor guanylyl cyclase Npr2, this spatial organization is disrupted. Peripheral SGN processes appear normal, but central SGN processes fail to bifurcate and are disorganized as they exit the auditory nerve. Within the cochlear nuclei, the tonotopic organization of the SGN terminal arbors is blurred and the aVCN is underinnervated with a reduced convergence of SGN inputs onto target neurons. The tonotopy of circuitry within the cochlear nuclei is also degraded, as revealed by changes in the topographic mapping of tuberculoventral cell projections from DCN to VCN. Nonetheless, Npr2 mutant SGN axons are able to transmit acoustic information with normal sensitivity and timing, as revealed by auditory brainstem responses and electrophysiological recordings from VCN neurons. Although most features of signal transmission are normal, intermittent failures were observed in responses to trains of shocks, likely due to a failure in action potential conduction at branch points in Npr2 mutant afferent fibers. Our results show that Npr2 is necessary for the precise spatial organization typical of central auditory circuits, but that signals are still transmitted with normal timing, and that mutant mice can hear even with these deficits.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago auditory scientists were very skeptical about the potential of new prosthetic approaches that electrically stimulated the auditory nerve, the cochlear nuclei (CN), and the inferior colliculus (IC). In those decades, the basilar membrane was considered to play a fundamental and irreplaceable role as a fine spectrum analyzer in hearing physiology, and therefore it was thought that electrical stimulation of the auditory system would have never produced functionally useful hearing. Over the last 30 years, cochlear implants (CIs) have improved steadily to the point where the average sentence recognition with modern multichannel devices is better than 90\% correct. More recently, similar performance has been observed with electric stimulation of the brainstem with auditory brainstem implants (ABIs). However, it is clear that to fully understand hearing and to design the next generation of prosthetic devices we must better understand the ear–brain relationship. Indeed some aspects of hearing do not require the intricate complexities of cochlear physiological responses, while other auditory tasks rely critically on specialized details of cochlear processing. The progress in electrical stimulation of the central auditory system requires us to reconsider the patient selection criteria for different implant devices, in particular to evaluate the possibility of ABIs for etiologies with poor outcomes with CIs. In the present review, the latest outcomes in restoration of hearing with ABI are presented. New guidelines are proposed for device selection for different etiologies and future research is suggested to further refine the process of matching an individual patient to the most appropriate implant device.},

METHODS This was a retrospective case series at a single tertiary academic referral center examining all ABI recipients from 1994 to 2016, which included 34 NF2 adults and 11 non-NF2 children. The morphologies of intraoperative EABRs were evaluated for the number of waveforms showing a response, the number of positive peaks in those responses, and the latencies of each of these peaks. RESULTS 27/34 adult NF2 patients and 9/10 children had EABR waveforms. 20/27 (74.0\%) of the adult patients and all of the children had ABI devices that stimulated post-operatively. When comparing the waveforms between adults who stimulated and those who did not stimulate, the proportion of total number of intraoperative EABR peaks to total possible peaks was significantly higher for the adults who stimulated than for those who did not (p {\textless} 0.05). Children had a significantly higher proportion of total number of peaks to total possible peaks when compared to adults who stimulated (p {\textless} 0.02). Additionally, there were more likely to be EABR responses at the initial stimulation than intraoperatively in the pediatric ABI population (p = 0.065). CONCLUSIONS The value of intraoperative EABR tracing may lie in its ability to predict post-operative auditory percepts based on the placement of the array providing the highest number of total peaks.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The Nucleus auditory brain stem implant (ABI) has been used in the hearing rehabilitation of totally deaf individuals for whom a cochlear implant is not an option such as in the case of neurofibroma-tosis type 2 (NF2). Intraoperative electrically evoked auditory brain stem responses (EABRs) are recorded to assist in the placement of the electrode array over the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei in the lateral recess of the IVth ventricle of the brain stem. This study had four objectives: (1) to characterize EABRs evoked by stimulation with an ABI in adolescents and adults with NF2, (2) to evaluate how the EABR morphology relates to auditory sensations elicited from stimulation by an ABI, (3) to establish whether there is evidence of morphology changes in the EABR with site of stimulation by the ABI, and (4) to investigate how the threshold of the EABR relates to behavioral threshold and comfortably loud sensations measured at initial device activation. Design: Intraoperative EABRs were recorded from 34 subjects with ABIs: 19 male and 15 female, mean age 27 yrs (range 12 to 52 yrs). ABI stimulation was applied at seven different sites using either wide bipolar stimulation across the array or in subsections of the array from medial to lateral and inferior to superior. The EABRs were analyzed with respect to morphology, peak latency, and changes in these characteristics with the site of stimulation. In a subset of eight subjects, additional narrow bipolar sites were stimulated to compare the intraoperative EABR threshold levels with the behavioral threshold (T) and comfortably loud (C) levels of stimulation required at initial device activation. Results: EABRs were elicited from 91\% of subjects. Morphology varied from one to four vertex-positive peaks with mean latencies of 0.76, 1.53, 2.51, and 3.64 msecs, respectively. The presence of an EABR from stimulation by electrodes across the whole array had a high predictive value for the presence of auditory electrodes at initial device activation. When examining subsections of the array, the absence of an EABR was a poor predictor for the absence of auditory electrodes. The morphology of the EABRs varied with site of stimulation in 16 cases, but there was no consistent pattern of change with stimulation site. There was a trend for more auditory electrodes to be present in stimulation sites that evoked EABRs with a higher number of peaks in the waveform. The EABR threshold was closer to the behavioral C level than the T level, but there was no overall correlation between the intraoperative EABR threshold level and the behavioral T and C levels. Conclusions: The presence of an intraoperative EABR corresponded well to the presence of auditory electrodes. The absence of an EABR from stimulating subsections of the array was not; however, a good indicator for the absence of auditory electrodes and the EABR from such stimulation would not be of assistance in identifying the nonauditory sections of the array to exclude in behavioral fitting of the device. The morphology of the EABR did not relate to site of stimulation. More peaks in the EABR was associated with a greater number of electrodes with auditory sensations, suggesting that correct positioning of the ABI activated more auditory subsystems within the cochlear nucleus. The intraoperative EABR thresholds did not correlate with the behavioral T and C levels and could not be used to assist in device fitting.},

	abstract = {The use of cochlear implants for selected individuals with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss who derive limited benefit from conventional hearing aids is well established. There are situations where cochlear implantation is contraindicated. Auditory brainstem implantation (ABI) is the only solution to restore hearing when the cochlear nerve is disrupted together with pathologies where the cochlea does not provide a suitable location for cochlear implant. Labyrinthine and cochlear aplasia and cochlear nerve aplasia constitute the congenital indications for ABI. In the present review article history and development of ABI, indications, side selection criteria, surgery and audiological outcome are presented.},

	abstract = {In a neuronal population, several combinations of its ionic conductances are used to attain a specific firing phenotype. Some neurons present heterogeneity in their firing, generally produced by expression of a specific conductance, but how additional conductances vary along in order to homeostatically regulate membrane excitability is less known. Dorsal cochlear nucleus principal neurons, fusiform neurons, display heterogeneous spontaneous action potential activity and thus represent an appropriate model to study the role of different conductances in establishing firing heterogeneity. Particularly, fusiform neurons are divided into quiet, with no spontaneous firing, or active neurons, presenting spontaneous, regular firing. These modes are determined by the expression levels of an intrinsic membrane conductance, an inwardly rectifying potassium current (IKir). In this work, we tested whether other subthreshold conductances vary homeostatically to maintain membrane excitability constant across the two subtypes. We found that Ih expression covaries specifically with IKir in order to maintain membrane resistance constant. The impact of Ih on membrane resistance is dependent on the level of IKir expression, being much smaller in quiet neurons with bigger IKir, but Ih variations are not relevant for creating the quiet and active phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate that the individual proportion of each conductance, and not their absolute conductance, is relevant for determining the neuronal firing mode. We conclude that in fusiform neurons the variations of their different subthreshold conductances are limited to specific conductances in order to create firing heterogeneity and maintain membrane homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Auditory streaming enables perception and interpretation of complex acoustic environments that contain competing sound sources. At early stages of central processing, sounds are segregated into separate streams representing attributes that later merge into acoustic objects. Streaming of temporal cues is critical for perceiving vocal communication, such as human speech, but our understanding of circuits that underlie this process is lacking, particularly at subcortical levels. The superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON), a prominent group of inhibitory neurons in the mammalian brainstem, has been implicated in processing temporal information needed for the segmentation of ongoing complex sounds into discrete events. The SPON requires temporally precise and robust excitatory input(s) to convey information about the steep rise in sound amplitude that marks the onset of voiced sound elements. Unfortunately, the sources of excitation to the SPON and the impact of these inputs on the behavior of SPON neurons have yet to be resolved. Using anatomical tract tracing and immunohistochemistry, we identified octopus cells in the contralateral cochlear nucleus (CN) as the primary source of excitatory input to the SPON. Cluster analysis of miniature excitatory events also indicated that the majority of SPON neurons receive one type of excitatory input. Precise octopus cell-driven onset spiking coupled with transient offset spiking make SPON responses well-suited to signal transitions in sound energy contained in vocalizations. Targets of octopus cell projections, including the SPON, are strongly implicated in the processing of temporal sound features, which suggests a common pathway that conveys information critical for perception of complex natural sounds.},

The results show that cats do indeed have a monaural mechanism for enhancing the detection of tones in co-located background noise for noise levels at least as high as 60 dB SPL. The ablation-behavior results show that surgical section of the dorsal (DAS) and most of the intermediate (IAS) striae has no measurable effect on this mechanism. In sharp contrast, even partial section of the trapezoid body results in a profound and permanent deficit and this deficit is not accounted for by hearing loss alone. It is concluded that the ascending and descending fibers in the dorsal and intermediate acoustic striae are neither necessary nor sufficient for enhancing the detection of salient sounds in a noisy environment while the ascending or descending fibers in the ventral acoustic stria are sufficient and probably necessary.},

It is known to be a major source of inhibition to the inferior colliculus (IC). It is also thought to play a role in coding the temporal aspects of sound, such as onsets and the periodic components of complex stimuli. In vivo intracellular recordings from VNLL neurons (n = 56) in urethane anesthetized rats revealed the presence of large-amplitude, short-duration, onset inhibition in a subset of neurons (14.3\%). This inhibition occurred before the first action potential (AP) elicited by noise or tone bursts, was broadly tuned to tonal frequency and was shown to delay the first AP. Our data suggest it is a result of an intrinsic circuit activated by the octopus cell pathway originating in the contralateral cochlear nucleus; this pathway is known to convey exquisitely timed and broadly tuned onset information.

Kittens were deafened by systemic ototoxic drug injections either as neonates or starting at postnatal day 30. Total CN volume, individual CN subdivision volumes, and cross-sectional areas of spherical cell somata in the anteroventral CN (AVCN) were compared in neonatally deafened and 30-day deafened groups at 8 weeks of age and in young adults after approximately 6 months of electrical stimulation initiated at 8 weeks of age. Both neonatal and early acquired hearing loss resulted in a reduction in CN volume as compared to normal hearing cats. Comparison of 8- and 32-week old groups indicated that the CN continued to grow in both deafened groups despite the absence of auditory input. Preserving normal auditory input for 30 days resulted in a significant increase in both total CN volume and cross-sectional areas of spherical cell somata, as compared to neonatally deafened animals. Restoring auditory input in these developing animals by unilateral intracochlear electrical stimulation did not elicit any difference in CN volume between the two sides, but resulted in 7\% larger spherical cell size on the stimulated side. Overall, the brief period of normal auditory development and subsequent electrical stimulation maintained CN volume at 80\% of normal and spherical cell size at 86\% of normal ipsilateral to the implant as compared to 67\% and 74\%, respectively, in the neonatally deafened group.},

METHODS We conducted cross-sectional analyses of 2001 through 2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on 9648 individuals aged 12 years or older. Hearing loss was defined as mild ({\textgreater} 25 dB through 40 dB), moderate ({\textgreater} 40 dB through 60 dB), severe ({\textgreater} 60 dB through 80 dB), or profound ({\textgreater} 80 dB). RESULTS An estimated 25.4 million, 10.7 million, 1.8 million, and 0.4 million US residents aged 12 years or older, respectively, have mild, moderate, severe, and profound better-ear hearing loss. Older individuals displayed a higher prevalence of hearing loss and more severe levels of loss. Across most ages, the prevalence was higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites than among non-Hispanic Blacks and was higher among men than women. CONCLUSIONS Hearing loss directly affects 23\% of Americans aged 12 years or older. The majority of these individuals have mild hearing loss; however, moderate loss is more prevalent than mild loss among individuals aged 80 years or older.

	abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 pA at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because pH excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

On the other hand, cell morphology in the ventral nucleus suggests that signal processing here is fundamentally similar to that in animals. A review of the organization of these cells in animals is presented to provide a context of present results.

Graphic reconstructions of the brain stem pathway illustrate differences in configuration of human auditory centers, such as mediolateral elongation of the cochlear nuclei and rostral prolongation of the superior olivary complex. Greater human brain stem size creates a considerably longer auditory pathway: the distance traversed by axons passing from the cochlear nuclei to the ipsilateral inferior colliculus is approximately 14 mm in the cat and 35 mm in man, while the distance to the contralateral colliculus is about 22 mm in the cat and 46 mm in man.

Specific cell types of the cochlear nuclear complex give rise to the fibers of the TB. Medium diameter fibers originate from spherical cells while globular cells are the source of the large diameter fibers. Bilateral cochlear nuclei ablations demonstrate that, with the possible exception of a few thin fibers, all midline TB fibers are second order. The discharge characteristics of single units recorded near the midline in the MDP, XDP, and LDP are presented. The MDP displays a dorso-ventral progression of best frequencies, from low to high. Very high best frequencies ({\textgreater} 12 kHz) do not seem to be represented in the MDP but are found in the XDP and LDP. Except for latent periods, the properties of units in the MDP are the same as those of spherical cells and eighth nerve fibers for all parameters where comparisons are available. The excitatory response characteristics of units in the XDP and LDP are similar to those of the MDP. They differ from MDP fibers in having tuning curves with inhibitory sidebands as well as a lower mean spontaneous rate of discharge.

	abstract = {The cochlear nucleus (CN) receives innervation from auditory and somatosensory structures, which can be identified using vesicular glutamate transporters, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. VGLUT1 is highly expressed in the magnocellular ventral CN (VCN), which receives auditory nerve inputs. VGLUT2 is predominantly expressed in the granule cell domain (GCD), which receives nonauditory inputs from somatosensory nuclei, including spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5) and cuneate nucleus (Cu). Two weeks after unilateral deafening VGLUT1 is significantly decreased in ipsilateral VCN while VGLUT2 is significantly increased in the ipsilateral GCD (Zeng et al., 2009), putatively reflecting decreased inputs from auditory nerve and increased inputs from nonauditory structures in guinea pigs. Here, we wished to determine whether the upregulation of VGLUT2 represents increases in the number of somatosensory projections to the CN that are maintained for longer periods of time. Thus, we examined concurrent changes in VGLUT levels and somatosensory projections in the CN using immunohistochemistry combined with anterograde tract tracing three and six weeks following unilateral deafening. The data reveal that unilateral deafness leads to increased numbers of VGLUT2-colabeled Sp5 and Cu projections to the ventral and dorsal CN. These findings suggest that Sp5 and Cu play significant and unique roles in cross-modal compensation and that, unlike after shorter term deafness, neurons in the magnocellular regions also participate in the compensation. The enhanced glutamatergic somatosensory projections to the CN may play a role in neural spontaneous hyperactivity associated with tinnitus. © 2012 the authors.},

Few studies have examined gene transfer to the central auditory system. The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the brainstem, which contains second order neurons of the auditory pathway, is a potential site for gene transfer. In this protocol, a technique for direct and maximal exposure of the murine DCN via a posterior fossa approach is demonstrated. This approach allows for either acute or survival surgery. Following direct visualization of the DCN, a host of experiments are possible, including injection of opsins into the cochlear nucleus and subsequent stimulation by an optical fiber coupled to a blue light laser. Other neurophysiology experiments, such as electrical stimulation and neural injector tracings are also feasible. The level of visualization and the duration of stimulation achievable make this approach applicable to a wide range of experiments.},

	abstract = {The vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) regulate the storage and release of glutamate in the brain. In adult animals, the VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 isoforms are widely expressed and differentially distributed, suggesting that neural circuits exhibit distinct modes of glutamate regulation. Studies in rodents suggest that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNA expression patterns are partly complementary, with VGLUT1 expressed at higher levels in the cortex and VGLUT2 prominent subcortically, but with overlapping distributions in some nuclei. In primates, VGLUT gene expression has not been previously studied in any part of the brain. The purposes of the present study were to document the regional expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNA in the auditory pathway through A1 in the cortex, and to determine whether their distributions are comparable to rodents. In situ hybridization with antisense riboprobes revealed that VGLUT2 was strongly expressed by neurons in the cerebellum and most major auditory nuclei, including the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, sagulum, and all divisions of the medial geniculate. VGLUT1 was densely expressed in the hippocampus and ventral cochlear nuclei, and at reduced levels in other auditory nuclei. In the auditory cortex, neurons expressing VGLUT1 were widely distributed in layers II-VI of the core, belt and parabelt regions. VGLUT2 was expressed most strongly by neurons in layers IIIb and IV, weakly by neurons in layers II-IIIa, and at very low levels in layers V-VI. The findings indicate that VGLUT2 is strongly expressed by neurons at all levels of the subcortical auditory pathway, and by neurons in the middle layers of the cortex, whereas VGLUT1 is strongly expressed by most if not all glutamatergic neurons in the auditory cortex and at variable levels among auditory subcortical nuclei. These patterns imply that VGLUT2 is the main vesicular glutamate transporter in subcortical and thalamocortical (TC) circuits, whereas VGLUT1 is dominant in corticocortical (CC) and corticothalamic (CT) systems of projections. The results also suggest that VGLUT mRNA expression patterns in primates are similar to rodents, and establish a baseline for detailed studies of these transporters in selected circuits of the auditory system.},

In the DCN 5.5\% of neurons were parvalbumin positive in the very old (30–39 months) mice, vs. 2.2\% in the 1 month old mice. In the DCN 3\% of the neurons were calbindin immunopositive in the 30–39 months mice compared to 1.9\% in the 1 month old group. In the PVCN, 20\% of the neurons in the very old mice were parvalbumin immunopositive, compared to 12\% in the young mice. Calbindin did not show any significant age-related differences in the PVCN. The total number of calretinin immunopositive neurons both in the DCN and PVCN did not show any significant change with increasing age. In conclusion, the total neuronal number in the DCN and PVCN was age-related and region-specific. While the neuronal number in the DCN and PVCN was decreased or unchanged, respectively, the calcium binding protein positive neuronal number showed a graded increase during aging in a region-specific and protein-specific manner.},

For this purpose electrical potential distributions around a conventional human intracochlear electrode (NUCLEUS-22) were measured in a tank, in cat cadaver cochleae and in living cat cochleae. Potential gradients were calculated where of importance. The values were compared to spatial tuning curves from cat primary auditory afferents in electrical mono-, bi-, and various tripolar stimulation modes. Finally, a lumped element model was developed to elucidate the single fiber data. Tank potential measurements show the principal features of the different stimulation modes but are not sufficient to explain all the features of experimental data from single fibers. Intracochlear potential measurements indicate an increase in spatial resolution in an apical direction. The single fiber data also confirm that a tripolar stimulus configuration provides significantly better spatial resolution than any other stimulation mode presently in use.},

	abstract = {Multipolar cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are a structurally and functionally diverse group of projection neurons. Understanding their role in the ascending pathway involves partitioning multipolar cells into distinct populations and determining where in the brain each sends its coded messages. In this study, we used retrograde labeling techniques in rats to identify multipolar neurons that project their axons to the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), the contralateral CN, or both structures. Three rats received injections of biotinylated dextran amine in the ipsilateral DCN and diamidino yellow in the contralateral CN. Several radiate multipolar neurons (defined by their axonal projections to the ipsilateral DCN and their dendrites that traverse VCN isofrequency sheets) were double-labeled but over 70\% were not. This result suggests two distinct populations: (1) radiate-commissural (RC) multipolar cells that project to the ipsilateral DCN and the contralateral CN, and (2) radiate multipolar cells that project exclusively (in this context) to the ipsilateral DCN. In a different group of animals, we retrogradely labeled multipolar neurons that project their axons to the contralateral CN and measured the size of their cell bodies. The mean size of this population (266 +/- 156 microm2) was significantly smaller than those of RC-multipolar cells (418 +/- 140 microm2). We conclude that the CN commissural pathway is composed of at least two components: (1) RC multipolar cells and (2) commissural multipolar cells that are small- and medium-sized neurons that project exclusively (in this context) to the contralateral CN. These results identify separate structural groups of multipolar cells that may correspond to physiological unit types described in the literature. They also provide protocols for isolating and studying different populations of multipolar cells to determine the neural mechanisms that govern their responses to sound.},

[Hearing Res. 127, 108-118 (1999)] suggested that the representation of electric stimulus waveforms in the temporal discharge patterns of auditory-nerve fiber (ANF) might be improved by introducing an ongoing, high-rate, desynchronizing pulse train (DPT). To test this hypothesis, activity of ANFs was studied in acutely deafened, anesthetized cats in response to 10-min-long, 5-kpps electric pulse trains that were sinusoidally modulated for 400 ms every second. Two classes of responses to sinusoidal modulations of the DPT were observed. Fibers that only responded transiently to the unmodulated DPT showed hyper synchronization and narrow dynamic ranges to sinusoidal modulators, much as responses to electric sinusoids presented without a DPT. In contrast, fibers that exhibited sustained responses to the DPT were sensitive to modulation depths as low as 0.25\% for a modulation frequency of 417 Hz. Over a 20-dB range of modulation depths, responses of these fibers resembled responses to tones in a healthy ear in both discharge rate and synchronization index. This range is much wider than the dynamic range typically found with electrical stimulation without a DPT, and comparable to the dynamic range for acoustic stimulation. These results suggest that a stimulation strategy that uses small signals superimposed upon a large DPT to encode sounds may evoke temporal discharge patterns in some ANFs that resemble responses to sound in a healthy ear.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implants provide a limited number of electrodes, each of which represents a channel of spectral information. Studies have shown that implant recipients are not receiving all of the information from the channels presented to their implant. The present paper provides a quantitative framework for evaluating how many spectral channels of information are necessary for speech recognition. Speech and melody recognition data from previous studies with cochlear implant simulations are compared as a function of the number of spectral channels of information. A quantitative model is applied to the results. Speech recognition performance increases as the number of spectral channels increases. A sigmoid function best describes this increase when plotted as a function of the log number of channels. As speech materials become more difficult, the function shifts to the right, indicating that more spectral channels of information are required. A model proposed by Plomp provides a single index to relate the difficulty of the task to the number of spectral channels needed for moderate recognition performance. In conclusion, simple sentence recognition in quiet can be achieved with only 3-4 channels of spectral information, while more complex materials can require 30 or more channels for an equivalent level of performance. The proposed model provides a single index that not only quantifies the number of functional channels in a cochlear implant, but also predicts the level of performance for different listening tasks},

A long-standing question is whether it is possible to independently activate two distinct neural populations in mammalian brain tissue. Such a capability would enable the examination of how different synapses or pathways interact to support computation. Here we report two new channelrhodopsins, Chronos and Chrimson, obtained through the de novo sequencing and physiological characterization of opsins from over 100 species of algae. Chrimson is 45 nm red-shifted relative to any previous channelrhodopsin, important for scenarios where red light would be preferred; we show minimal visual system mediated behavioral artifact in optogenetically stimulated Drosophila. Chronos has faster kinetics than any previous channelrhodopsin, yet is effectively more light-sensitive. Together, these two reagents enable crosstalk-free two-color activation of neural spiking and downstream synaptic transmission in independent neural populations in mouse brain slice.},

	abstract = {Objective: The penetrating electrode auditory brainstem implant (PABI) is an extension of auditory brainstem implant (ABI) technology originally developed for individuals deafened by neurofibromatosis type 2. Whereas the conventional ABI uses surface electrodes on the cochlear nuclei, the PABI uses 8 or 10 penetrating microelectrodes in conjunction with a sepa-rate array of 10 or 12 surface electrodes. The goals of the PABI were to use microstimulation to reduce threshold current levels, increase the range of pitch percepts, and improve electrode selectivity and speech recognition. Patients and Protocol: In a prospective clinical trial, 10 indi-viduals, all with neurofibromatosis type 2, received a PABI after vestibular schwannoma removal via a translabyrinthine approach. All study participants met strict requirements for informed consent as part of a Food and Drug Administration clinical trial. Approximately 8 weeks after implantation, PABI devices were activated and tested at our tertiary clinical and research facility. Mean follow-up time was 33.8 months. Study Design: Using a single-subject design, we measured thresholds and dynamic ranges, electrode-specific pitch per-cepts, and speech perception performance at regular intervals. Results: Penetrating electrodes produced auditory thresholds at substantially lower charge levels than surface electrodes, a wide range of electrode-specific pitch sensations, and minimal cross-electrode interference and could be used in speech maps either alone or in combination with surface electrodes. However, less than 25\% of penetrating electrodes resulted in auditory sensa-tions, whereas more than 60\% of surface electrodes were effec-tive. Even after more than 3 years of experience, patients using penetrating electrodes did not achieve improved speech recog-nition compared with those using surface electrode ABIs. In patients with usable penetrating electrodes, City University of New York Sentence Test scores with sound and visual informa-tion were 61.6\% in the PABI group and 64.7\% in a surface ABI cohort (p = not significant). Conclusion: The PABI met the goals of lower threshold, increased pitch range, and high selectivity, but these properties did not result in improved speech recognition.

The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) provides useful hearing sensations to patients with no auditory nerve by electrically stimulating the cochlear nucleus complex in the brainstem (1Y7). As of 2008, more than 700 patients worldwide have received the ABI, most of whom lost their auditory nerve from neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) (8). The ABI provides sound awareness and discrimina-tion and is a significant supplement to lipreading (6,9Y16). However, most NF2 patients with the ABI receive little or no open-set speech recognition (17).},

	abstract = {Optogenetics has become an important research tool and is being considered as the basis for several neural prostheses. However, few studies have applied optogenetics to the auditory brainstem. This study explored whether optical activation of the cochlear nucleus (CN) elicited responses in neurons in higher centers of the auditory pathway and whether it elicited an evoked response. Viral-mediated gene transfer was used to express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the mouse CN. Blue light was delivered via an optical fiber placed near the surface of the infected CN and recordings were made in higher-level centers. Optical stimulation evoked excitatory multiunit spiking activity throughout the tonotopic axis of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (IC) and the auditory cortex (Actx). The pattern and magnitude of IC activity elicited by optical stimulation was comparable to that obtained with a 50dB SPL acoustic click. This broad pattern of activity was consistent with histological confirmation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) label of cell bodies and axons throughout the CN. Increasing pulse rates up to 320Hz did not significantly affect threshold or bandwidth of the IC responses, but rates higher than 50Hz resulted in desynchronized activity. Optical stimulation also evoked an auditory brainstem response, which had a simpler waveform than the response to acoustic stimulation. Control cases showed no responses to optical stimulation. These data suggest that optogenetic control of central auditory neurons is feasible, but opsins with faster channel kinetics may be necessary to convey information at rates typical of many auditory signals.},

	abstract = {Unlike many European nations, the USA has no regulations concerning the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), a technique employed during some fertility treatments to select embryos based on their genes. As such, PGD can and is used for a variety of controversial purposes, including sex selection, selection for children with disabilities such as deafness, and selection for ‘saviour siblings’ who can serve as tissue donors for sick relatives. The lack of regulation, which is due to particular features of the US political and economic landscape, has ethical and practical implications for patients seeking PGD around the world. This paper contrasts the absence of PGD oversight in the USA with existing PGD policies in Switzerland, Italy, France and the UK. The primary reasons why PGD is not regulated in the USA are addressed, with consideration of factors such as funding for assisted reproductive technology treatmemt and the proximity of PGD to the contentious abortion debate. The obstacles that would need to be overcome in the USA for PGD to be regulated in the future are outlined. Then, the significance of the current divergence in PGD policy for patients around the world are discussed. Regulatory differences create opportunities for reproductive tourism, which result in legal, health and moral challenges. The paper concludes with comments on the need for policymakers around the world to balance respect for the characters and constitutions of their individual countries with appreciation of the needs of infertile patients across the globe.},

	abstract = {The axons of commissural neurons that project from one cochlear nucleus to the other were studied after labeling with anterograde tracer. Injections were made into the dorsal subdivision of the cochlear nucleus in order to restrict labeling only to the group of commissural neurons that gave off collaterals to, or were located in, this subdivision. The number of labeled commissural axons in each injection was correlated with the number of labeled radiate multipolar neurons, suggesting radiate neurons as the predominant origin of the axons. The radiate commissural axons are thick and myelinated, and they exit the dorsal acoustic stria of the injected cochlear nucleus to cross the brainstem in the dorsal half, near the crossing position of the olivocochlear bundle. They enter the opposite cochlear nucleus via the dorsal and ventral acoustic stria and at its medial border. Reconstructions of single axons demonstrate that terminations are mostly in the core and typically within a single subdivision of the cochlear nucleus. Extents of termination range from narrow to broad along both the dorsoventral (i.e., tonotopic) and the rostrocaudal dimensions. In the electron microscope, labeled swellings form synapses that are symmetric (in that there is little postsynaptic density), a characteristic of inhibitory synapses. Our labeled axons do not appear to include excitatory commissural axons that end in edge regions of the nucleus. Radiate commissural axons could mediate the broadband inhibition observed in responses to contralateral sound, and they may balance input from the two ears with a quick time course. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Octopus cells, located in the mammalian auditory brainstem, receive their excitatory synaptic input exclusively from auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). They respond with accurately timed spikes but are broadly tuned for sound frequency. Since the representation of information in the auditory nerve is well understood, it is possible to pose a number of questions about the relationship between the intrinsic electrophysiology, dendritic morphology, synaptic connectivity, and the ultimate functional role of octopus cells in the brainstem. This study employed a multi-compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley model to determine whether dendritic delay in octopus cells improves synaptic input coincidence detection in octopus cells by compensating for the cochlear traveling wave delay. The propagation time of post-synaptic potentials from synapse to soma was investigated. We found that the total dendritic delay was approximately 0.275 ms. It was observed that low-threshold potassium channels in the dendrites reduce the amplitude dependence of the dendritic delay of post-synaptic potentials. As our hypothesis predicted, the model was most sensitive to acoustic onset events, such as the glottal pulses in speech when the synaptic inputs were arranged such that the model's dendritic delay compensated for the cochlear traveling wave delay across the ANFs. The range of sound frequency input from ANFs was also investigated. The results suggested that input to octopus cells is dominated by high frequency ANFs.},

Neither of these tracts projects to principal nuclei of the superior olivary complex, but rather they have overlapping projections to ipsilateral periolivary cell groups which partially surround the lateral superior olivary nucleus. Contralaterally, axons in the stria of Held project to: (i) The dorsomedial periolivary cell group; (ii) the anterolateral periolivary cell group; (iii) the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus; and (iv) the inferior colliculus. Fibers in the trapezoid body project to the contralateral ventromedial periolivary cell group. The possibility that these projections represent, in part, inputs to cells which give rise to the olivocochlear bundle is discussed. In contrast to AVCN which projects to the lateral and medial superior olivary nuclei proper, PVCN projects to adjacent periolivary cell groups, but both AVCN and PVCN project in an overlapping fashion to the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus; bilaterally. This result lends further support to the idea that the cochlear nucleus is a complex of subnuclei each of which has specific sets of projections.},

But their behavioral audiograms, obtained by the classical conditioning technique of Ehret, are very discrepant. Even though the behavioral audiogram of the CBA/J mouse can be predicted by measurements from its auditory nerve, the behavioral thresholds of the young C57BL/6 mouse are approximately 40 dB less sensitive than its electrophysiological measurements. Cochlear hair cell loss was not evident in young mice of either genotype. As the CBA/J approaches the end of its predicted life span, its auditory anatomy, physiology and behavior are not significantly altered; but those rare individuals who exceed their predicted life span by 40\% finally develop hearing loss of a mixed nature. By contrast, the C57BL/6 mouse shows a relatively rapid decline of hearing as it ages. By 200 days of age, its auditory nerve responses are 30 dB less sensitive at 5 kHz, and 55 dB less sensitive at 30 kHz, than similar measures taken at adolescence. Over this same age span, its behavioral sensitivity has only declined by 15 and 25 dB at these two frequencies. © 1980 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

	abstract = {1. Response thresholds and dynamic range properties of neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of awake cats were measured by fitting a computational model to rate-level functions for best frequency (BF) tone bursts and for bursts of broad-band noise. Dynamic range measurements were performed in quiet and in the presence of continuous background noise. 2. The sample of neurons obtained in the VCN of awake cats exhibited a variety of peristimulus histograms (PSTHs) and thresholds. All PSTH response types previously described in the VCN of anesthetized cats were found in awake cats. The lowest thresholds for neural responses were observed at sound pressure levels that were equivalent to behavioral thresholds of absolute auditory sensitivity. 3. When responses to BF tones or bursts of broad-band noise were recorded in quiet backgrounds, the dynamic range properties of most units in the VCN of awake cats were not significantly different from dynamic range properties of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) in anesthetized cats or VCN units in decerebrate cats. All auditory units showed a larger dynamic range for noise bursts than for tone bursts, but VCN units with primary-like and onset PSTHs showed larger dynamic ranges for responses to noise bursts than that of ANFs and VCN chopper units. 4. When tests were performed in the presence of continuous noise, rate-level functions for BF tone bursts shifted to higher tone levels and showed a more compressed range of driven rates in comparison with data obtained in quiet. Compression of the rate-level function in noise resulted from an increase in driven rate at low tone levels and a decrease in rate at high tone levels. These changes in the rate-level function suggest that noise may reduce the range of BF tone levels that are potentially encoded by a unit's rate responses. By exhibiting larger shifts and less compression in background noise, VCN units in awake cats better preserved the dynamic range of their rate responses to BF tones than ANFs in anesthetized cats or VCN units in decerebrate cats. 5. Rate-level functions were obtained from a small sample of VCN units not only with the cat performing the behavioral task but also with the cat awake and sitting quietly in the testing apparatus. No differences in noise-induced shift or compression were noted between the two testing conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED While conversing in a crowded social setting, a listener is often required to follow a target speech signal amid multiple competing speech signals (the so-called "cocktail party" problem). In such situations, separation of the target speech signal in azimuth from the interfering masker signals can lead to an improvement in target intelligibility, an effect known as spatial release from masking (SRM). This study assessed the contributions of two stimulus properties that vary with separation of sound sources, binaural envelope (ENV) and temporal fine structure (TFS), to SRM in normal-hearing (NH) human listeners. Target speech was presented from the front and speech maskers were either colocated with or symmetrically separated from the target in azimuth. The target and maskers were presented either as natural speech or as "noise-vocoded" speech in which the intelligibility was conveyed only by the speech ENVs from several frequency bands; the speech TFS within each band was replaced with noise carriers. The experiments were designed to preserve the spatial cues in the speech ENVs while retaining/eliminating them from the TFS. This was achieved by using the same/different noise carriers in the two ears. A phenomenological auditory-nerve model was used to verify that the interaural correlations in TFS differed across conditions, whereas the ENVs retained a high degree of correlation, as intended. Overall, the results from this study revealed that binaural TFS cues, especially for frequency regions below 1500 Hz, are critical for achieving SRM in NH listeners. Potential implications for studying SRM in hearing-impaired listeners are discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Acoustic signals received by the auditory system pass first through an array of physiologically based band-pass filters. Conceptually, at the output of each filter, there are two principal forms of temporal information: slowly varying fluctuations in the envelope (ENV) and rapidly varying fluctuations in the temporal fine structure (TFS). The importance of these two types of information in everyday listening (e.g., conversing in a noisy social situation; the "cocktail-party" problem) has not been established. This study assessed the contributions of binaural ENV and TFS cues for understanding speech in multiple-talker situations. Results suggest that, whereas the ENV cues are important for speech intelligibility, binaural TFS cues are critical for perceptually segregating the different talkers and thus for solving the cocktail party problem.},

How the auditory system manages to extract intelligible speech under such acoustically complex and adverse listening conditions is not known, and, indeed, it is not clear how attended speech is internally represented. Here, using multi-electrode surface recordings from the cortex of subjects engaged in a listening task with two simultaneous speakers, we demonstrate that population responses in non-primary human auditory cortex encode critical features of attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based on cortical responses to the mixture of speakers reveal the salient spectral and temporal features of the attended speaker, as if subjects were listening to that speaker alone. A simple classifier trained solely on examples of single speakers can decode both attended words and speaker identity. We find that task performance is well predicted by a rapid increase in attention-modulated neural selectivity across both single-electrode and population-level cortical responses. These findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of speech does not merely reflect the external acoustic environment, but instead gives rise to the perceptual aspects relevant for the listener’s intended goal. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Despite the prevalence of sounds rich in harmonic structures in our everyday hearing environment, it has remained largely unknown what neural mechanisms are used by the primate auditory cortex to extract these biologically important acoustic structures. In this study, we discovered a unique class of harmonic template neurons in the core region of auditory cortex of a highly vocal New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), across the entire hearing frequency range. Marmosets have a rich vocal repertoire and a similar hearing range to that of humans. Responses of these neurons show nonlinear facilitation to harmonic complex sounds over inharmonic sounds, selectivity for particular harmonic structures beyond two-tone combinations, and sensitivity to harmonic number and spectral regularity. Our findings suggest that the harmonic template neurons in auditory cortex may play an important role in processing sounds with harmonic structures, such as animal vocalizations, human speech, and music.},

We neonatally deafened 17 cats before the onset of hearing, thereby abolishing virtually all afferent input from the auditory periphery. In seven animals the auditory pathway was chronically reactivated with environmentally derived electrical stimuli presented via a multichannel intracochlear electrode array implanted at 8 weeks of age. Electrical stimulation was provided by a clinical cochlear implant that was used continuously for periods of up to 7 months. In 10 long-term deafened cats and three age-matched normal-hearing controls, an intracochlear electrode array was implanted immediately prior to cortical recording. We recorded from a total of 812 single unit and multiunit clusters in AI of all cats as adults using a combination of single tungsten and multichannel silicon electrode arrays. The absence of afferent activity in the long-term deafened animals had little effect on the basic response properties of AI neurons but resulted in complete loss of the normal cochleotopic organization of AI. This effect was almost completely reversed by chronic reactivation of the auditory pathway via the cochlear implant. We hypothesize that maintenance or reestablishment of a cochleotopically organized AI by activation of a restricted sector of the cochlea, as demonstrated in the present study, contributes to the remarkable clinical performance observed among human patients implanted at a young age.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified bilateral regions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) whose responses varied with segment length. This effect was absent in primary auditory cortex and did not occur for quilts made from other natural sounds or acoustically matched synthetic sounds, suggesting tuning to speech-specific spectrotemporal structure. When examined parametrically, the STS response increased with segment length up to {\textasciitilde}500 ms.

Ferrets in which retinal projections are redirected neonatally to the auditory thalamus have visually responsive cells in auditory thalamus and cortex, form a retinotopic map in auditory cortex and have visual receptive field properties in auditory cortex that are typical of cells in visual cortex. Here we report that this cross-modal projection and its representation in auditory cortex can mediate visual behaviour. When light stimuli are presented in the portion of the visual field that is 'seen' only by this projection, 'rewired' ferrets respond as though they perceive the stimuli to be visual rather than auditory. Thus the perceptual modality of a neocortical region is instructed to a significant extent by its extrinsic inputs. In addition, gratings of different spatial frequencies can be discriminated by the rewired pathway, although the grating acuity is lower than that of the normal visual pathway.},

Current neurocomputational theories of auditory streaming rely on tonotopic organization of the auditory system to explain the observation that sequential spectrally distant sound elements tend to form separate perceptual streams. Here, we show that spectral components that are well separated in frequency are no longer heard as separate streams if presented synchronously rather than consecutively. In contrast, responses from neurons in primary auditory cortex of ferrets show that both synchronous and asynchronous tone sequences produce comparably segregated responses along the tonotopic axis. The results argue against tonotopic separation per se as a neural correlate of stream segregation. Instead we propose a computational model of stream segregation that can account for the data by using temporal coherence as the primary criterion for predicting stream formation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The computational and representational mechanisms underlying these observations, however, remain largely unknown. Here we combine high spatial resolution (3 and 7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling to reveal how natural sounds are represented in the human brain. We compare competing models of sound representations and select the model that most accurately predicts fMRI response patterns to natural sounds. Our results show that the cortical encoding of natural sounds entails the formation of multiple representations of sound spectrograms with different degrees of spectral and temporal resolution. The cortex derives these multi-resolution representations through frequency-specific neural processing channels and through the combined analysis of the spectral and temporal modulations in the spectrogram. Furthermore, our findings suggest that a spectral-temporal resolution trade-off may govern the modulation tuning of neuronal populations throughout the auditory cortex. Specifically, our fMRI results suggest that neuronal populations in posterior/dorsal auditory regions preferably encode coarse spectral information with high temporal precision. Vice-versa, neuronal populations in anterior/ventral auditory regions preferably encode fine-grained spectral information with low temporal precision. We propose that such a multi-resolution analysis may be crucially relevant for flexible and behaviorally-relevant sound processing and may constitute one of the computational underpinnings of functional specialization in auditory cortex.},

Our brains must therefore organize the input arising from multiple sources into separate "streams" and, in the case of speech, map the acoustic components of the target signal onto meaning. These auditory and linguistic processes have traditionally been considered to occur sequentially and are typically studied independently [1, 2]. However, evidence that streaming is modified or reset by attention [3], and that lexical knowledge can affect reports of speech sound identity [4, 5], suggests that higher-level factors may influence perceptual organization. In two experiments, listeners heard sequences of repeated words or acoustically matched nonwords. After several presentations, they reported that the initial /s/ sound in each syllable formed a separate stream; the percept then fluctuated between the streamed and fused states in a bistable manner. In addition to measuring these verbal transformations, we assessed streaming objectively by requiring listeners to detect occasional targets - syllables containing a gap after the initial /s/. Performance was better when streaming caused the syllables preceding the target to transform from words into nonwords, rather than from nonwords into words. Our results show that auditory stream formation is influenced not only by the acoustic properties of speech sounds, but also by higher-level processes involved in recognizing familiar words. © 2013 The Authors.},

To address how these plasticity processes are coordinated over the course of functional recovery, we tracked receptive field reorganization, spontaneous activity, and response gain from individual principal neurons in the adult mouse auditory cortex over a 50-day period surrounding either moderate or massive auditory nerve damage. We related the day-by-day recovery of sound processing to dynamic changes in the strength of intracortical inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory neurons. Whereas the status of brainstem-evoked potentials did not predict the recovery of sensory responses to surviving nerve fibers, homeostatic adjustments in PV-mediated inhibition during the first days following injury could predict the eventual recovery of cortical sound processing weeks later. These findings underscore the potential importance of self-regulated inhibitory dynamics for the restoration of sensory processing in excitatory neurons following peripheral nerve injuries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {1. Single-unit responses in the dorsal cochlear nucleus of unanesthetized, decerebrate cats have been divided into two categoreis. These have been differentiated on the basis of responses to best-frequency tones. Type IV units responded to best-frequency tones with excitation from threshold to about 20 or 30 dB above threshold; at higher levels, their response was inhibitory. In a few cases, the excitatory area near threshold was not seen and in a few others, the response became excitatory again at high levels. Type IV units could be divided into two groups based on the length of time that inhibition was maintained in response to long tones. Type IV units are not seen in anesthetized cats. 2. Type II/III units responded to best-frequency tones of all levels with excitation. Nonmonotonic rate versus level functions were seen in type II/III units, but they were of much less drastic character; the discharge rate of nonmonotonic type II/III units was still well above spontaneous rate for tones 50 dB above threshold. Type II/III units defined in this way were found to have, on the average, lower rates of spontaneous activity and higher thresholds than type IV units. 3. Type II/III units responded weakly to broad-band noise in comparison to auditory nerve fibers and many of them did not respond at all to noise. Type IV units, with best frequencies above 0.9 kHz, gave excitatory responses to noise. 4. The inhibitory response areas of type IV units could be divided into two areas: a central inhibitory area in the vicinity of best frequency where on- and off-discharges and afterdischarges were seen; and inhibitory side bands at higher and lower frequencies where simple inhibitory responses were seen. In four units, it was possible to show that the central inhibitory area was converted to an excitatory area after administration of an anesthetic dose of pentobarbital. 5. Most type II/III and type IV units could be excited or inhibited by stimuli in the contralateral ear. Broad-band noise was a more effective contralateral stimulus than tones at the ipsilateral best frequency. 6. On the basis of the properties of type II/III and type IV cells, it is suggested that type II/III responses are recorded from interneurons which provide a large share of the inhibitory imput to type IV cells.},

The results of open-set speech perception tests, both words and sentences, were reviewed to assess auditory functioning after implantation. Qualitative data using the Performance Inventory for Profound and Severe Loss questionnaire were also collected for the adults. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results of this study indicate that individuals with long-term prelinguistic deafness can achieve significant open-set speech understanding with a cochlear implant, although there is a wide range of performance across patients.

	abstract = {Despite its potential practical and theoretical importance, earli-er studies on the development of the central auditory system rarely targeted the auditory cortex, more often focusing on sub-cortical auditory nuclei 1,2 . There, in animals with normal cochleae and brains, the state of maturation of the cochlea deter-mines developmental progressions, although some neuronal plas-ticity has also been suggested to be involved in functional maturation 3–5 . Studies of the kitten auditory cortex and the chick auditory cortex analog have revealed a precocious adult-like tono-topic organization at an early postnatal stage, but have not addressed the question of how that organization emerges 6–8 . Although numerous studies on the development of visual or somatosensory cortex 9–11 have been done to address the extents and the ways in which the structural and functional development of the cortex is modified by early environmental or learning expe-riences, such studies in the auditory cortex are rare 2,12,13 . A potentially great capacity for representational plasticity in the auditory cortex during development as well as in adulthood, and an important role for auditory inputs during development have been suggested by the results of earlier studies. A partial cochlear lesion introduced either during development or in adult-hood results in an expansion of the representations of neighbor-ing frequencies within cortical field A1, commonly completely occupying the normal territory of representation of missing fre-quencies 14,15 . Behavioral training can result in a large-scale reor-ganization of the adult auditory cortex 12,16–20 . Rewiring of retinal inputs into the auditory thalamus in the infant ferret or hamster leads to the formation of feature-selective visual responses, retino-topic maps and orientation columns in A1 (refs. 21–23), consis-tent with the argument that the functional organization of this cortical area is highly dependent on the specific spectrotempo- This study demonstrates that the adult form of 'tonotopic maps' of sound frequency in the rat pri-mary auditory cortex (A1) arises from parallel developmental processes involving two cortical zones: the progressive differentiation and refinement of selectively tone-responsive receptive fields within an initially broadly-tuned posterior zone, and the progressive loss of tone-evoked, short-latency response over an initially large, very broadly tuned anterior zone. The formation of tonotopic maps in A1 was specifically influenced by a rat pup's early acoustic environments. Exposure to pulsed tones resulted in accelerated emergence and an expansion of A1 representations of those specific tone frequencies, as well as a deteriorated tonotopicity and broader-than-normal receptive fields. Thus, auditory experiences during early postnatal development are important in shaping the functional development of auditory cortical representations of specific acoustic environments. ral structures of its predominant neuronal inputs. Correlation between the development of speech reception abilities and early language-specific speech exposure has been well-documented, apparently manifesting a powerful, early capacity of plasticity for complex-stimulus specific (for example, native language-specific) auditory cortex organization in human infants 24–26 . These findings collectively suggest that the auditory cortex is highly plastic in young brains, and indeed, for at least behav-iorally important stimuli, remains plastic throughout life. In this study, the progressive development of tonotopic organization and frequency-selective ('tuned') receptive fields of neurons were systematically examined in the auditory cortex of both naive and tone-exposed rats. Our findings demonstrate that early acoustic experiences significantly contribute to the functional shaping of the structural organization and signal processing capacities of the primary auditory cortex during postnatal development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present experiment was to assess the consequences of cochlear implantation at different ages on the development of the human central auditory system. DESIGN: Our measure of the maturity of central auditory pathways was the latency of the P1 cortical auditory evoked potential. Because P1 latencies vary as a function of chronological age, they can be used to infer the maturational status of auditory pathways in congenitally deafened children who regain hearing after being fit with a cochlear implant. We examined the development of P1 response latencies in 104 congenitally deaf children who had been fit with cochlear implants at ages ranging from 1.3 yr to 17.5 yr and three congenitally deaf adults. The independent variable was the duration of deafness before cochlear implantation. The dependent variable was the latency of the P1 cortical auditory evoked potential. RESULTS: A comparison of P1 latencies in implanted children with those of age-matched normal-hearing peers revealed that implanted children with the longest period of auditory deprivation before implantation-7 or more yr-had abnormal cortical response latencies to speech. Implanted children with the shortest period of auditory deprivation-approximately 3.5 yr or less-evidenced age-appropriate latency responses within 6 mo after the onset of electrical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in the absence of normal stimulation there is a sensitive period of about 3.5 yr during which the human central auditory system remains maximally plastic. Plasticity remains in some, but not all children until approximately age 7. After age 7, plasticity is greatly reduced. These data may be relevant to the issue of when best to place a cochlear implant in a congenitally deaf child.},

From 200 multiunit recordings, no response to visual stimuli could be found in A1 of any of the investigated animals. Using the current source-density analysis of local field potentials, no local generators of field potentials could be found within A1, despite of the presence of small local field potentials. No multiunit responses to somatosensory stimulation (whiskers, face, pinna, head, neck, all paws, back, tail) could be obtained.

The development of N(b) waves was delayed and altered and the long latency responses became smaller than in controls at the second and third months.

	abstract = {Sensory environments are known to shape nervous system organization. Here we show that passive long-term exposure to a spectrally enhanced acoustic environment (EAE) causes reorganization of the tonotopic map in juvenile cat auditory cortex without inducing any hearing loss. The EAE consisted of tone pips of 32 different frequencies (5-20 kHz), presented in random order at an average rate of 96 Hz. The EAE caused a strong reduction of the representation of EAE frequencies and an over-representation of frequencies neighboring those of the EAE. This is in sharp contrast with earlier developmental studies showing an enlargement of the cortical representation of EAEs consisting of a narrow frequency band. We observed fewer than normal appropriately tuned short-latency responses to EAE frequencies, together with more common long-latency responses tuned to EAE-neighboring frequencies.},

Focal iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer, biocytin, were made into the vMGB of neonatal rabbits to examine the morphological organization of auditory thalamocortical (TC) afferents prior to hearing onset. TC afferents terminated in distinct patches as early as postnatal day 1 (PD-0 = day of birth), 6 days before the behavioral onset of hearing. In contrast to TC afferents in adults, the terminal arbors of neonatal vMGB axons occupied the entire depth of the cortical plate and lamina I. Serial section reconstructions revealed that single vMGB axons in neonates branched to form multiple patches within the cortical plate. Collaterals also extended to lamina I where they coursed tangentially for several millimeters. An unusual feature of the neonatal TC patches was the contribution of descending collaterals from axons coursing in lamina I. The presence of distinct patches prior to hearing onset indicates that the segregation of auditory TC axons occurs in the absence of acoustically driven activity. The extensive postnatal remodeling of TC axons, however, may indicate activity-dependent refinement of arbor size. © 1994.},

It is, however, complemented by top-down influences that direct and modulate the residual (adult) capacity for circuit reorganization. In a deprived condition, this developmental step is substantially affected. As higher-order representations cannot be established in absence of auditory experience, the developmental decrease in capacity for "bottom-up regulated" reorganizations (as repeatedly demonstrated in also in deprived sensory systems) cannot be complemented by an increasing influence of top-down modulations.

Behavioral, electroencephalographic, and imaging data in humans correspond well to data behavioral and neurophysiological data obtained from congenitally deaf cats. The available data indicate that auditory deprivation leads to 'decoupling' of the primary auditory cortex from cognitive modulation of higher-order auditory areas. Higher-order auditory areas undergo a strong cross-modal reorganization and take-over new functions. Due to these and other deficits of intrinsic microcircuitry, the cortical column can not integrate bottom-up and top-down influences in deaf auditory cortex.

In this fMRI study, we explore the joint involvement of occipital and right hemisphere regions in a visual-based phonological task in post-lingual deafness. Intriguingly, we show that some deaf subjects perform faster than controls. This behavioural effect is associated with reorganized connectivity across bilateral visual, right temporal and left inferior frontal cortices, but with poor CI outcome. Conversely, preserved normal-range reaction times are associated with left-lateralized phonological processing and good CI outcome. These results suggest that following deafness, involvement of visual cortex in the context of reorganized right-lateralized phonological processing compromises its availability for audio-visual synergy during adaptation to CI.},

	abstract = {The primary sensory cortex is positioned at a confluence of bottom-up dedicated sensory inputs and top-down inputs related to higher-order sensory features, attentional state, and behavioral reinforcement. We tested whether topographic map plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex and a secondary auditory area, the suprarhinal auditory field, was controlled by the statistics of bottom-up sensory inputs or by top-down task-dependent influences. Rats were trained to attend to independent parameters, either frequency or intensity, within an identical set of auditory stimuli, allowing us to vary task demands while holding the bottom-up sensory inputs constant. We observed a clear double-dissociation in map plasticity in both cortical fields. Rats trained to attend to frequency cues exhibited an expanded representation of the target frequency range within the tonotopic map but no change in sound intensity encoding compared with controls. Rats trained to attend to intensity cues expressed an increased proportion of nonmonotonic intensity response profiles preferentially tuned to the target intensity range but no change in tonotopic map organization relative to controls. The degree of topographic map plasticity within the task-relevant stimulus dimension was correlated with the degree of perceptual learning for rats in both tasks. These data suggest that enduring receptive field plasticity in the adult auditory cortex may be shaped by task-specific top-down inputs that interact with bottom-up sensory inputs and reinforcement-based neuromodulator release. Top-down inputs might confer the selectivity necessary to modify a single feature representation without affecting other spatially organized feature representations embedded within the same neural circuitry.},

	abstract = {The acoustic signal is crucial for animals to obtain information from the surrounding environment. Like other sensory modalities, the central auditory system undergoes adaptive changes (i.e., plasticity) during the developmental stage as well as other stages of life. Owing to its plasticity, auditory centers may be susceptible to various factors, such as medical intervention, variation in ambient acoustic signals and lesion of the peripheral hearing organ. There are critical periods during which auditory centers are vulnerable to abnormal experiences. Particularly in the early postnatal development period, aural inputs are essential for functional maturity of auditory centers. An aural deprivation model, which can be achieved by attenuating or blocking the peripheral acoustic afferent input to the auditory center, is ideal for investigating plastic changes of auditory centers. Generally, auditory plasticity includes structural and functional changes, some of which can be irreversible. Aural deprivation can distort tonotopic maps, disrupt the binaural integration, reorganize the neural network and change the synaptic transmission in the primary auditory cortex or at lower levels of the auditory system. The regulation of specific gene expression and the modified signal pathway may be the deep molecular mechanism of these plastic changes. By studying this model, researchers may explore the pathogenesis of hearing loss and reveal plastic changes of the auditory cortex, facilitating the therapeutic advancement in patients with severe hearing loss. After summarizing developmental features of auditory centers in auditory deprived animals and discussing changes of central auditory remodeling in hearing loss patients, we aim at stressing the significant of an early and well-designed auditory training program for the hearing rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {We have examined the effect of restricted unilateral cochlear lesions on the orderly topographic mapping of sound frequency in the auditory cortex of adult guinea pigs. These lesions, although restricted in spatial extent, resulted in a variety of patterns of histological damage to receptor cells and nerve fibres within the cochlea. Nevertheless, all lesions resulted in permanent losses of sensitivity of the cochlear neural output across a limited frequency range. Thirty-five to 81 days after such damage to the organ of Corti, the area of contralateral auditory cortex in which the lesioned frequency range would normally have been represented was partly occupied by an expanded representation of sound frequencies adjacent to the frequency range damaged by the lesion. The thresholds at their new characteristic frequencies (CFs) of clusters of cortical neurones in these regions were close to normal thresholds at those frequencies (mean difference across all animals was 3.8 dB). In a second series of experiments, the responses of neurone clusters were examined within hours of making similar cochlear lesions. It was found that shifts in CF toward frequencies spared by the lesions could occur, but thresholds were greatly elevated compared to normal (mean difference was 31.7 dB in five animals). The emergence of sensitive drive in such regions after prolonged recovery periods in lesioned animals thus suggests that the auditory cortical frequency map undergoes reorganization in cases of partial deafness. Some features of this reorganization are similar to changes reported in somatosensory cortex after peripheral nerve injury, and this form of plasticity may therefore be a feature of all adult sensory systems.},

However, a wide variance among patients is known to exist regardless of the age at CI [Sarant, J.Z., Blamey, P.J., Dowell, R.C., Clark, G.M., Gibson, W.P., 2001. Variation in speech perception scores among children with cochlear implants. Ear Hear. 22, 18-28]. In a previous study, we reported that prelingually deaf children in the age range 5-7 years at implantation showed greatest outcome variability [Oh S.H., Kim C.S., Kang E.J., Lee D.S., Lee H.J., Chang S.O., Ahn S.H., Hwang C.H., Park H.J., Koo J.W., 2003. Speech perception after cochlear implantation over a 4-year time period. Acta Otolaryngol. 123, 148-153]. Eleven children who underwent CI between the age of 5 and 7 1/2 years were subdivided into a good (above 65\%: GOOD) and a poor (below 45\%: POOR) group based on the performance in a speech perception test given 2 years after CI. The preoperative18F-FDG-PET (F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) images were compared between the two groups in order to examine if regional glucose metabolic difference preexisted before the CI surgery. In the GOOD group, metabolic activity was greater in diverse fronto-parietal regions compared to the POOR group. In the POOR group, the regions related to the ventral visual pathway showed greater metabolic activity relative to the GOOD group. These findings suggest that the deaf children who had developed greater executive and visuospatial functions subserved by the prefrontal and parietal cortices might be successful in auditory language learning after CI. On the contrary, greater dependency on the visual function subserved by the occipito-temporal region due to auditory deprivation may interfere with acquisition of auditory language after CI. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental conditions were words, syllables and environmental sounds, each controlled by a noise baseline. Four categories of effect were observed: (i) regions that were recruited by patients and controls under identical task conditions: the left and right superior temporal cortices and the left insula were activated in both groups in all conditions; (ii) new regions, which were recruited by patients only: the left dorsal occipital cortex showed systematic activation in all conditions versus noise baselines; (iii) regions that were recruited by both groups with a different functional specificity; e.g. Wernicke's area responded specifically to speech sounds in controls but was not specialized in patients; and (iv) regions that were activated in one group more than the other: the precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus (patients more than controls) and the left inferior frontal, left posterior inferior temporal and left and right temporoparietal junction regions (controls more than patients). These data provide evidence for altered functional specificity of the superior temporal cortex, flexible recruitment of brain regions located within and outside the classical language areas and automatic contribution of visual regions to sound recognition in implant patients.},

	abstract = {The auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX) of barn owls is highly plastic, especially during early life. When juvenile owls are reared with prismatic spectacles (prisms) that displace the visual field laterally, the auditory spatial tuning of neurons in the ICX adjusts adaptively to match the visual displacement. In the present study, we show that this functional plasticity is accompanied by axonal remodeling. The ICX receives auditory input from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) via topographic axonal projections. We used the anterograde tracer biocytin to study experience-dependent changes in the spatial pattern of axons projecting from the ICC to the ICX. The projection fields in normal adults were sparser and more restricted than those in normal juveniles. The projection fields in prism-reared adults were denser and broader than those in normal adults and contained substantially more bouton-laden axons that were appropriately positioned in the ICX to convey adaptive auditory spatial information. Quantitative comparison of results from juvenile and prism-reared owls indicated that prism experience led to topographically appropriate axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis. We conclude that this elaboration of axons represents the formation of an adaptive neuronal circuit. The density of axons and boutons in the normal projection zone was preserved in prism-reared owls. The coexistence of two different circuits encoding alternative maps of space may underlie the ability of prism-reared owls to readapt to normal conditions as adults.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED Controversy regarding functional reorganization in the adult brain remains. To investigate whether neuroplasticity is present in adults with postlingual deafness, we examined the pattern of cerebral glucose metabolism on (18)F-FDG brain PET images of postlingually deaf patients by comparing the auditory cortical activation pattern with those of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We also correlated the cerebral glucose metabolism in deaf patients with the duration of deafness using statistical parametric mapping. METHODS In the resting state (eye closed, ears unoccluded in a dark and quiet environment), (18)F-FDG brain PET scans were performed on 9 postlingually deaf patients and 9 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Significant increases and decreases of regional cerebral metabolism in the patient group were estimated by comparing their PET images with those of the healthy volunteers using t statistics at every voxel. To reveal regions in which metabolism was significantly correlated with the duration of deafness, the general linear model with the duration of deafness as a covariate was tested at each voxel. RESULTS When we compared (18)F-FDG brain PET images of postlingually deaf patients with those of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects by performing a t test at every voxel, the glucose metabolism of deaf patients was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) lower than that of the control subjects in both anterior cingulate gyri (Brodmann area 24 [BA24]) and superior temporal cortices (BA41, BA42) and in the right parahippocampal gyrus. No area showed a significant increase of metabolism in deaf patients with the same threshold. When we correlated glucose metabolism of deaf patients with the duration of deafness after total deprivation of hearing capability using a general linear model with the duration of deafness as a covariate at every voxel, metabolism in both anterior cingulate gyri (BA24) and superior temporal cortices (BA41, BA42) showed a significant (P {\textless} 0.005) positive correlation with the duration of deafness. CONCLUSION This study suggests that plasticity is present in adult brains of postlingually deaf patients. In the mature brain, auditory deprivation decreased neuronal activity transiently in primary auditory and auditory-related cortices, and, over time, functional reorganization likely takes place in the auditory cortex. Plasticity was prominent in superior temporal and anterior cingulate gyri in the sensory-deprived mature brain and militated against postimplantation improvement in patients with cochlear implants.},

	abstract = {The effects of auditory deprivation on the spatial distribution of cortical response thresholds to electrical stimulation of the adult cat cochlea were evaluated. Threshold distributions for single- and multiple-unit responses from the middle cortical layers were obtained on the ectosylvian gyrus in three groups of animals: adult, acutely implanted animals ("acute group"); adult animals, 2 wk after deafening and implantation ("short-term group"); adult, neonatally deafened animals ("long-term group") implanted after 2-5 years of deafness. For all three groups, we observed similar patterns of circumscribed regions of low response thresholds in the region of primary auditory cortex (AI). A dorsal and a ventral region of low response thresholds were found separated by a narrow, anterior-posterior strip of elevated thresholds. The two low-threshold regions in the acute and the short-term group were arranged cochleotopically. This was reflected in a systematic shift of the cortical locations with minimum thresholds as a function of cochlear position of the radial and monopolar stimulation electrodes. By contrast, the long-term deafened animals maintained only weak or no signs of cochleotopicity. In some cases of this group, significant deviations from a simple tri-partition of the dorsoventral axis of AI was observed. Analysis of the spatial extent of the low-threshold regions revealed that the activated area in acute cases was significantly smaller than the long- and the short-term cases for both dorsal and ventral AI. There were no significant differences in the rostrocaudal extent of activation between long- and short-term deafening, although the total activated area in the short-term cases was larger than in long-term deafened animals. The width of the narrow high-threshold ridge that separated the dorsal and ventral low-threshold regions was the widest for the acute cases and the narrowest for the short-term deafened animals. The findings of relative large differences in cortical response distributions between the acute and short-term animals suggests that the effects observed in long-term deafened animals are not solely a consequence of loss of peripheral innervation density. The effects may reflect electrode-specific effects or reorganizational changes based on factors such as differences in excitatory and inhibitory balance.},

	abstract = {Although much is known about the cerebral neural plasticity that occurs after deafness, it is unclear how much time is required for its development or what other cortical changes may consequently occur. This study provides a longitudinal assessment of cerebral cortical neural plasticity, as manifested in adult deafened cats. A total of 5 male cats were subjected to whole cortex analysis of glucose metabolic activity via 2-deoxy-2[18F] fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) micro-positron emission tomography (PET). The imaging was performed at the baseline state of normal hearing and then at 4, 9, 24, and 33 months after the induction of deafness. We compared glucose metabolism between the normal hearing state and each deafened state by using voxel-based statistical analysis (P {\textless} 0.005). Significant changes were observed in the primary auditory (A1) and primary visual (V1) cortices. A bilateral metabolic decrease was observed in A1 areas and in temporal auditory fields, the extent of which was significantly increased at Month 9. Then it was declined at Month 24. And finally it was disappeared by Month 33. Auditory cortical plasticity subsequent to deafness was thus demonstrated. Furthermore, a significant metabolic upsurge occurred in bilateral occipital areas at Month 33. This increase, involving bilateral occipital and thalamic areas of V1, suggests compensatory hyperactivity of the visual cortex after deafness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Profoundly deaf children who use a cochlear implant (CI) provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of auditory sensory deprivation on the maturing human central nervous system. Previous results suggest that children fitted with a CI show evidence of altered auditory cortical maturation, based on evoked potentials. This altered maturation was characterized by both latency delays and morphological changes in the cortical auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Based on prolonged P(1) latencies compared to age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers, these data suggested a delayed maturation nearly equivalent to the period of deafness. However, rates of maturation for this AEP peak were essentially the same in NH and CI children. This suggests that, given enough time, the AEPs of CI children would assume the characteristic morphology found in older NH teens and NH adults. However, the data also indicated a substantial alteration of the typical set of obligatory P(1)-N(1b)-P(2) peaks, specifically related to the absence of the N(1) potential. Recent analyses of more extensive sets of longitudinal and cross-sectional data indicate that even after many years of implant use, the AEPs of CI users in their late teens remain very different from those of their NH peers. The P(1) peak latency remains prolonged and P(1) amplitude remains much larger in CI users than in age-matched NH teens. These findings suggested that age-related changes in the P(1) peak are completed by 12 years of age. In addition, the normal N(1b) peak fails to emerge in virtually all of the CI children tested in our laboratory. A major new interpretation of the abnormal maturation of AEP waveforms in CI children is presented. It is based on direct evidence showing that a persistent immaturity of the superficial layer axons has persistent negative effects on the generation of the N(1b) and, consequently, on the morphology of the AEPs. A comparison of scalp-recorded AEPs from implanted children with local field potentials measured from the cortical surface in deaf white kittens suggests the effects of deafness and CI use are similar across these mammalian species. For both species, a period of profound deafness followed by CI stimulation reveals a substantial immaturity in cortical activation even after a period of electrical stimulation by the CI.},

	abstract = {Inhibitory synapse dysfunction may contribute to many developmental brain disorders, including the secondary consequences of sensory deprivation. In fact, developmental hearing loss leads to a profound reduction in the strength of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in the auditory cortex, and this deficit persists into adulthood. This finding is consistent with the general theory that the emergence of mature synaptic properties requires activity during development. Therefore, we tested the prediction that inhibitory strength can be restored following developmental hearing loss by boosting GABAergic transmission in vivo. Conductive or sensorineural hearing loss was induced surgically in gerbils prior to hearing onset and GABA agonists were then administered for one week. IPSCs were subsequently recorded from pyramidal neurons in a thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Administration of either a GABA(A) receptor a1 subunit specific agonist (zolpidem), or a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor (SGRI), rescued IPSC amplitude in hearing loss animals. Furthermore, this restoration persisted in adults, long after drug treatment ended. In contrast, a GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen did not restore inhibitory strength. IPSCs could also be restored when SGRI administration began 3 weeks after sensory deprivation. Together, these results demonstrate long-lasting restoration of cortical inhibitory strength in the absence of normal experience. This suggests that in vivo GABA(A) receptor activation is sufficient to promote maturation, and this principle may extend to other developmental disorders associated with diminished inhibitory function.},

At 90-108 h, virus-infected neurons were found bilaterally in the medial geniculate body and in layer V of the auditory cortex.

Following a period of auditory experience, we investigated cortical field potentials in response to electrical biphasic pulses applied by means of the cochlear implant. In comparison to naive unstimulated deaf cats and normal hearing cats, the chronically stimulated animals showed larger cortical regions producing middle-latency responses at or above 300 microV amplitude at the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral auditory cortex. The cortex ipsilateral to the chronically stimulated ear did not show any signs of reduced responsiveness when stimulating the 'untrained' ear through a second cochlear implant inserted in the final experiment. With comparable duration of auditory training, the activated cortical area was substantially smaller if implantation had been performed at an older age of 5-6 months.

	abstract = {Congenital auditory deprivation (deafness) leads to a dysfunctional intrinsic cortical microcircuitry. This chapter reviews these deficits with a particular emphasis on layer-specific activity within the primary auditory cortex. Evidence for a delay in activation of supragranular layers and reduction in activity in infragranular layers is discussed. Such deficits indicate the incompetence of the primary auditory cortex to not only properly process thalamic input and generate output within the infragranular layers, but also incorporate top-down modulations from higher order auditory cortex into the processing within primary auditory cortex. Such deficits are the consequence of a misguided postnatal development. Maturation of primary auditory cortex in deaf animals shows evidence of a developmental delay and further alterations in gross synaptic currents, spread of activation, and morphology of local field potentials recorded at the cortical surface. Additionally, degenerative changes can be observed. When hearing is initiated early in life (e.g., by chronic cochlear-implant stimulation), many of these deficits are counterbalanced. However, plasticity of the auditory cortex decreases with increasing age, so that a sensitive period for plastic adaptation can be demonstrated within the second to sixth months of life in the deaf cat. Potential molecular mechanisms of the existence of sensitive period are discussed. Data from animal research may be compared to electroencephalographic data obtained from cochlear-implanted congenitally deaf children. After cochlear implantation in humans, three phases of plastic adaptation can be observed: a fast one, taking place within the first few weeks after implantation, showing no sensitive period; a slower one, taking place within the first months after implantation (a sensitive period up to 4 years of age); and possibly a third, and the longest one, related to increasing activation of higher order cortical areas. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An excitotoxin, kainic acid, was injected into various parts of the cochlear nucleus (CN) or into the superior olivary complex (SOC). The locations of the resulting lesions were correlated with the changes produced in the various extrema of the BAEP waveforms. The results indicate that: (1) the earliest BAEP extrema (P1, N1 (recorded between vertex and the earbar ipsilateral to the stimulus) and P1a, P1b, (vertex to contralateral earbar)) are generated by cells with somata peripheral to the CN; (2) P2 is primarily generated by posterior anteroventral CN (AVCNp) and anterior posteroventral CN (PVCNa) cells; (3) SOC, anterior anteroventral CN (AVCNa), AVCNp, and PVCNa cells are involved in generating P3; (4) AVCNa cells are the main CN cells involved in P4, N4, and P5 generation; (5) both ipsilateral and contralateral SOC cells have a role in generating monaurally evoked P4 and P5; and (6) P5 is generated by cells with characteristic frequencies below 10 kHz. From (2) and (4), it is clear that P2 and P4-P5 are generated by cells in distinct, parallel pathways.},

	abstract = {This paper is the first in a series aimed at identifying the cellular generators of the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) in cats. The approach involves (1) developing experimental procedures for making small selective lesions and determining the corresponding changes in BAEP waveforms, (2) identifying brainstem regions involved in BAEP generation by examining the effects of lesions on the BAEP and (3) identifying specific cell populations involved by combining the lesion results with electrophysiological and anatomical information from other kinds of studies. We created lesions in the lower brainstem by injecting kainic acid which is generally toxic for neuronal cell bodies but not for axons and terminals. This first paper describes the justifications for using kainic acid, explains the associated problems, and develops a methodology that addresses the main difficulties. The issues and aspects of the specific methods are generally applicable to physiological and anatomical studies using any neurotoxin, as well as to the present BAEP study. The methods chosen involved (1) measuring the BAEP at regular intervals until it reached a post-injection steady state and perfusing the animals with fixative shortly after the last BAEP recordings were made, (2) using objective criteria to distinguish injection-related BAEP changes from unrelated ones, (3) making control injections to identify effects not due to kainic acid toxicity, (4) verifying the anatomical and functional integrity of axons in lesioned regions, and (5) examining injected brainstems microscopically for cell loss and cellular abnormalities indicating dysfunction. This combination of methods enabled us to identify BAEP changes which are clearly correlated with lesion locations.},

	abstract = {We investigated speech recognition in noise in subjects with mild to profound levels of unilateral hearing loss. Thirty-five adults were evaluated using an adaptive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR50) sentence recognition threshold test in three spatial configurations. The results revealed a significant correlation between pure-tone average audiometric thresholds in the poorer ear and SNR thresholds in the two conditions where speech and noise were spatially separated: dichotic – with speech presented to the poorer ear and reverse dichotic – with speech presented to the better ear. This first result suggested that standard pure-tone air-conduction thresholds can be a reliable predictor of speech recognition in noise for binaural conditions. However, a subgroup of 14 subjects was found to have poorer-than-expected speech recognition scores, especially in the reverse dichotic listening condition. In this subgroup 9 subjects had been diagnosed with vestibular schwannoma at stage III or IV likely affecting the lower brainstem function. These subjects showed SNR thresholds in the reverse dichotic condition on average 4 dB poorer (higher) than for the other 21 normally-performing subjects. For the 7 of 9 subjects whose vestibular schwannoma was removed, the deficit was no longer apparent on average 5 months following the surgical procedure. These results suggest that following unilateral hearing loss the capacity to use monaural spectral information is supported by the lower brainstem.},

	abstract = {Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) can restore useful hearing to persons with deafness who cannot benefit from cochlear implants. However, the quality of hearing restored by ABIs rarely is comparable to that provided by cochlear implants in persons for whom those are appropriate. In an animal model, we evaluated elements of a prototype of an ABI in which the functions of macroelectrodes on the surface of the dorsal cochlear nucleus would be integrated with the function of multiple penetrating microelectrodes implanted into the ventral cochlear nucleus. The surface electrodes would convey most of the range of loudness percepts while the intranuclear microelectrodes would sharpen and focus pitch percepts. In the present study, stimulating electrodes were implanted chronically on the surface of the animal's dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and also within their ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). Recording microelectrodes were implanted into the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). The electrical stimuli were sinusoidally modulated stimulus pulse trains applied on the DCN and within the VCN. Temporal encoding of neuronal responses was quantified as vector strength (VS) and as full-cycle rate of neuronal activity in the ICC. VS and full-cycle AP rate were measured for 4 stimulation modes; continuous and transient amplitude modulation of the stimulus pulse trains, each delivered via the macroelectrode on the surface of the DCN and then by the intranuclear penetrating microelectrodes. In the proposed clinical device the functions of the surface and intranuclear microelectrodes could best be integrated if there is minimal variation in the neuronal responses across the range of modulation depth, modulation frequencies, and across the four stimulation modes. In this study VS did vary as much as 34\% across modulation frequency and modulation depth within a stimulation mode, and up to 40\% between modulation modes. However, these intra- and inter-mode variances differed for different stimulation rates, and at 500 Hz the inter-mode differences in VS and across the range of modulation frequencies and modulation depths was{\textless}Roman{\textgreater} = {\textless}/Roman{\textgreater}24\% and the intra-modal differences were{\textless}Roman{\textgreater} = {\textless}/Roman{\textgreater}15\%. The findings were generally similar for rate encoding of modulation depth, although the depth of transient amplitude modulation delivered by the surface electrode was weakly encoded as full-cycle rate. Overall, our findings support the concept of a clinical ABI that employs surface stimulation and intranuclear microstimulation in an integrated manner.},

Controller, weighing 190 g, is placed on animal's back and provides bidirectional sustained telemetry rate of 500 kb/s , allowing real-time control of stimulation parameters and viewing of acquired data. In continuously-active state, controller consumes approximately 420 mW and operates without recharge for 8 h . It features independent 16-channel current-controlled stimulation, allowing current steering; customizable stimulus current waveforms; recording of stimulus voltage waveforms and evoked neuronal responses with stimulus artifact blanking circuitry. Flexibility, scalability, cost-efficiency, and a user-friendly computer interface of this device allow use in animal testing for variety of neuroprosthetic applications. Initial testing of the controller has been done in a feline model of brainstem auditory prosthesis. In this model, the electrical stimulation is applied to the array of microelectrodes implanted in the ventral cochlear nucleus, while the evoked neuronal activity was recorded with the electrode implanted in the contralateral inferior colliculus. Stimulus voltage waveforms to monitor the access impedance of the electrodes were acquired at the rate of 312 kilosamples/s. Evoked neuronal activity in the inferior colliculus was recorded after the blanking (transient silencing) of the recording amplifier during the stimulus pulse, allowing the detection of neuronal responses within 100 mus after the end of the stimulus pulse applied in the cochlear nucleus.},

	abstract = {Filters are widely used for the modulation, typically attenuation, of amplitudes of different frequencies within neurophysiological signals. Filters, however, also induce changes in the phases of different frequencies whose amplitude is unmodulated. These phase shifts cause time lags in the filtered signals, leading to a disruption of the timing information between different frequencies within the same signal and between different signals. The emerging time lags can be either constant in the case of linear phase (LP) filters, or vary as a function of the frequency in the more common case of non-linear phase (NLP) filters. Since filters are used ubiquitously online in the early stages of data acquisition, the vast majority of neurophysiological signals thus suffer from distortion of the timing information even prior to their sampling. This distortion is often exacerbated by further multiple offline filtering stages of the sampled signal. The distortion of timing information may cause misinterpretation of the results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Here we present a variety of typical examples of filter-induced phase distortions and discuss the evaluation and restoration of the timing information underlying the original signal.

Significance Statement Filters are a common tool used in the processing of neuronal signals. In addition to their effect on the amplitude of different frequencies, filters also have a significant impact on their phases, which results in the distortion of the underlying timing information. This distortion, which arises by the online filters used in most neurophysiological systems and is exacerbated by further offline filtering, may cause severe misinterpretation of the results and lead to false conclusions. This manuscript presents different cases in which the timing information is disrupted and discusses the evaluation and correction of the underlying phase shifts.},

We focus our functional analysis on the fast-switching, red light-activated Chrimson variants, because red light has lower light scattering and marginal phototoxicity in tissues. We show paradigmatically for neurons of the cerebral cortex and the auditory nerve that the fast Chrimson mutants enable neural stimulation with firing frequencies of several hundred Hz. They drive spiking at high rates and temporal fidelity with low thresholds for stimulus intensity and duration. Optical cochlear implants restore auditory nerve activity in deaf mice.

	abstract = {Amplitude modulation (AM) is a temporal feature of most natural acoustic signals. A long psychophysical tradition has shown that AM is important in a variety of perceptual tasks, over a range of time scales. Technical possibilities in stimulus synthesis have reinvigorated this field and brought the modulation dimension back into focus. We address the question whether specialized neural mechanisms exist to extract AM information, and thus whether consideration of the modulation domain is essential in understanding the neural architecture of the auditory system. The available evidence suggests that this is the case. Peripheral neural structures not only transmit envelope information in the form of neural activity synchronized to the modulation waveform but are often tuned so that they only respond over a limited range of modulation frequencies. Ascending the auditory neuraxis, AM tuning persists but increasingly takes the form of tuning in average firing rate, rather than synchronization, to modulation frequency. There is a decrease in the highest modulation frequencies that influence the neural response, either in average rate or synchronization, as one records at higher and higher levels along the neuraxis. In parallel, there is an increasing tolerance of modulation tuning for other stimulus parameters such as sound pressure level, modulation depth, and type of carrier. At several anatomical levels, consideration of modulation response properties assists the prediction of neural responses to complex natural stimuli. Finally, some evidence exists for a topographic ordering of neurons according to modulation tuning. The picture that emerges is that temporal modulations are a critical stimulus attribute that assists us in the detection, discrimination, identification, parsing, and localization of acoustic sources and that this wide-ranging role is reflected in dedicated physiological properties at different anatomical levels.},

	abstract = {Intracortical microelectrode arrays record multi-unit extracellular activity for neurophysiology studies and for brain-machine interface applications. The common first step is neural spike-detection; a process complicated by common-noise signals from motion artifacts, electromyographic activity, and electric field pickup, especially in awake/behaving subjects. Often common-noise spikes are very similar to neural spikes in their magnitude, spectral, and temporal features. Provided sufficient spacing exists between electrodes of the array, a local neural spike is rarely recorded on multiple electrodes simultaneously. This is not true for distant common-noise sources. Two new techniques compatible with standard spike-detection schemes are introduced and evaluated. The first method, virtual referencing (VR), takes the average recording from all functional electrodes in the array (represents the signal from a virtual-electrode at the array's center) and subtracts it from the test electrode signal. The second method, inter-electrode correlation (IEC), computes a correlation coefficient between threshold exceeding candidate spike segments on the test electrode and concurrent segments from remaining electrodes. When sufficient correlation is detected, the candidate spike is rejected as originating from a distant common-noise source. The performance of these algorithms was compared with standard thresholding and differential referencing approaches using neural recordings from un-anaesthetized rats. By evaluating characteristics of mean-spike waveforms generated by each method under different levels of common-noise, it was found that IEC consistently offered the most robust means of neural spike-detection. Furthermore, IEC's rejection of supra-threshold events not likely originating from local neurons significantly reduces data handling for downstream spike sorting and processing operations.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous recordings of multiple neuron activities with multi-channel extracellular electrodes are widely used for studying infor-mation processing by the brain's neural circuits. In this method, the recorded signals containing the spike events of a number of adjacent or distant neurons must be correctly sorted into spike trains of individual neurons, and a variety of methods have been proposed for this spike sorting. However, spike sorting is computationally difficult because the recorded signals are often contami-nated by biological noise. Here, we propose a novel method for spike detection, which is the first stage of spike sorting and hence crucially determines overall sorting performance. Our method utilizes a model of extracellular recording data that takes into account variations in spike waveforms, such as the widths and amplitudes of spikes, by detecting the peaks of band-pass-filtered data. We show that the new method significantly improves the cost–performance of multi-channel electrode recordings by increas-ing the number of cleanly sorted neurons.},

	abstract = {The activity of auditory-nerve fibers was recorded in anesthetized cats in response to sinusoidal electric stimuli applied through a bipolar electrode pair inserted about 5 mm into the cochlea through the round window. The synchronization index was calculated from period histograms for frequencies ranging from 0.2 to over 10 kHz. The stimulus artifact was largely eliminated through the use of differential micropipettes and an adaptive digital filter. Measured synchronization indices were many times larger than the indices that could be attributed to the residual stimulus artifact. Synchronization indices at each stimulus frequency varied considerably from fiber to fiber, even in the same animal. The dependence of synchrony on stimulus frequency was also variable, decreasing monotonically in some fibers and nonmonotonically in others. The average electric synchronization index for all fibers did not fall as steeply with frequency as does the average synchrony for acoustic stimuli. The finding of significant phase locking to electric stimuli well above 1 kHz suggests that the poor frequency discrimination of cochlear-implant recipients for single-channel stimulation above this frequency may be due to the inability of the central procesor to make effective use of the available phase-locking information for monaural stimulation.},

The challenge has continued to accept submissions, and the best so far has resulted from cooperation between two teams. The challenge has probably saturated, as algorithms cannot progress beyond limits set by ambiguities inherent in 2D scoring and the size of the test dataset. Retrospective evaluation of the challenge scoring system reveals that it was not sufficiently robust to variations in the widths of neurite borders.

Due to the complexity of the auditory brainstem, and indeed most brain circuits, the dynamic behavior of the system may be difficult to predict without a detailed, biologically realistic computational model. Despite the sensitivity of models to their exact construction and parameters, most prior models of the cochlear nucleus have incorporated only a small subset of the known biological properties. This confounds the interpretation of modelling results and also limits the potential future uses of these models, which require a large effort to develop. To address these issues, we have developed a general purpose, biophysically detailed model of the cochlear nucleus for use both in testing hypotheses about cochlear nucleus function and also as an input to models of downstream auditory nuclei. The model implements conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley representations of cells using a Python-based interface to the NEURON simulator. Our model incorporates most of the quantitatively characterized intrinsic cell properties, synaptic properties, and connectivity available in the literature, and also aims to reproduce the known response properties of the canonical cochlear nucleus cell types. Although we currently lack the empirical data to completely constrain this model, our intent is for the model to continue to incorporate new experimental results as they become available.},

We explored the use of optogenetics to deliver spatially restricted and cell-specific excitation in the cochlea of adult Mongolian gerbils. Adeno-associated virus carrying the gene encoding the light-sensitive calcium translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh) was injected into the cochlea of adult gerbils. SGNs in all cochlea turns showed stable and long-lasting CatCh expression, and electrophysiological recording from single SGNs showed that light stimulation up to few hundred Hertz induced neuronal firing. We characterized the light-induced activity in the auditory pathway by electrophysiological and behavioral analysis. Light- and sound-induced auditory brainstem responses showed similar kinetics and amplitude. In normal hearing adult gerbils, optical cochlear implants elicited stable optical auditory brainstem responses over a period of weeks. In normal hearing animals, light stimulation cued avoidance behavior that could be reproduced by subsequent acoustic stimulation, suggesting similar perception of light and acoustic stimuli. Neurons of the primary auditory cortex of normal hearing adult gerbils responded with changes in firing rates with increasing light intensity. In deaf adult gerbils, light stimulation generated auditory responses and cued avoidance behavior indicating partial restoration of auditory function. Our data show that optogenetic cochlear stimulation achieved good temporal fidelity with low light intensities in an adult rodent model, suggesting that optogenetics might be used to develop cochlear implants with improved restorative capabilities.},

Three types of threshold measures were taken: detection of amplitude modulation, detection of low-frequency sinusoidal current waveforms, and detection of beats in two-tone complexes. The temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF), defined as the plot of modulation detection thresholds as a function of modulation frequency, show low-pass filter characteristics with similar cutoff frequencies for all three tasks. The similarity of these three measures suggests a common temporal mechanism. While modulation detection differs somewhat in normal-hearing and implanted listeners, both exhibit the same general characteristics. The TMTFs are low pass with a cutoff frequency near 70 Hz for normal-hearing listeners and near 140 Hz for implanted listeners. Patients with cochlear implants can best detect temporal modulation at modulation frequencies below 300 Hz, and are most sensitive to 80- to 100-Hz modulation. At high carrier levels many implant patients could detect smaller modulation amplitudes than normal-hearing listeners, a finding that is consistent with the smaller intensity DLs for some implanted listeners at high levels. These results demonstrate that, while implant listeners cannot discriminate steady-state, high-frequency stimuli, speech information might be conveyed by the envelope of the high-frequency components of speech.},

	abstract = {Temporal modulations in stimulus amplitude are essential for recognizing and categorizing behaviorally relevant acoustic signals such as speech. Despite this behavioral importance, it remains unclear how amplitude modulations (AMs) are represented in the responses of neurons at higher levels of the auditory system. Studies using stimuli with sinusoidal amplitude modulations (SAMs) have shown that the responses of many neurons are strongly tuned to modulation frequency, leading to the hypothesis that AMs are represented by their periodicity in the auditory midbrain. However, AMs in general are defined not only by their modulation frequency, but also by a number of other parameters (duration, duty cycle, etc.), which covary with modulation frequency in SAM stimuli. Thus the relationship between modulation frequency and neural responses as characterized with SAM stimuli alone is ambiguous. In this study, we characterize the representation of AMs in the gerbil inferior colliculus by analyzing neural responses to a series of pulse trains in which duration and interpulse interval are systematically varied to quantify the importance of duration, interpulse interval, duty cycle, and modulation frequency independently. We find that, although modulation frequency is indeed an important parameter for some neurons, the responses of many neurons are also strongly influenced by other AM parameters, typically duration and duty cycle. These results suggest that AMs are represented in the auditory midbrain not only by their periodicity, but by a complex combination of several important parameters.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) of decerebrate cats show three major response patterns when tones of different frequencies and sound-pressure levels (SPLs) are presented to the contralateral ear. The frequency response maps of type I units are uniquely defined by a narrow excitatory area at best frequency (BF: a unit's most sensitive frequency) and surrounding inhibition at higher and lower frequencies. As a result of this receptive field organization, type I units exhibit strong excitatory responses to BF tones but respond only weakly to broadband noise (BBN). These response characteristics predict that type I units are well suited to encode narrowband signals in the presence of background noise. To test this hypothesis, the dynamic range properties of ICC unit types were measured under quiet conditions and in multiple levels of continuous noise. As observed in previous studies of the auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus, type I units showed upward threshold shifts and discharge rate compression in background noise that partially degraded the dynamic range properties of neural representations at high noise levels. Although the other two unit types in the ICC showed similar trends in threshold shift and noise compression, their ability to encode auditory signals was compromised more severely in increasing noise levels. When binaural masking effects were simulated, only type I units showed an enhanced representation of spatially separated signals and maskers that was consistent with human perceptual performance in independent psychoacoustic observations. These results support the interpretation that type I units play an important role in the auditory processing of narrowband signals in background noise and suggest a physiological basis for spatial factors that govern signal detection under free-field listening conditions.},

This study extends the description of these response types by assessing their ipsilateral and binaural response map properties. Here the nature of ipsilateral inputs is evaluated directly using frequency response maps and compared with results obtained from methods that rely on sensitivity to interaural level differences (ILDs). In general, there is a one-to-one correspondence between observed ipsilateral input characteristics and those inferred from ILD manipulations. Type V units receive ipsilateral excitation and show binaural facilitation (EE properties); type I and type O units receive ipsilateral inhibition and show binaural excitatory/inhibitory (EI) interactions. Analyses of binaural frequency response maps show that these ILD effects extend over the entire receptive field of ICC units. Thus the range of frequencies that elicits excitation from type V units is expanded with increasing levels of ipsilateral stimulation, whereas the excitatory bandwidth of type I and O units decreases under the same binaural conditions. For the majority of ICC units, application of bicuculline, an antagonist for GABAA-mediated inhibition, does not alter the basic effects of binaural stimulation; rather, it primarily increases spontaneous and maximum discharge rates. These results support our previous interpretations of the putative dominant inputs to ICC response types and have important implications for midbrain processing of competing free-field sounds that reach the listener with different directional signatures.},

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. SETTING Tertiary care center. PATIENTS Ninety-eight patients with SCD, preoperative threshold audiograms, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) thresholds, and computed tomography (CT) imaging were included. Clinical reports were reviewed for self-reported SCD symptoms. Twenty-five patients completed the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Autophony Index (AI), and the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Correlations between preoperative low-frequency air-bone gap (ABG), cVEMP thresholds, and symptoms (including HHI, DHI, AI, and SF-36). Symptoms included hearing loss, aural fullness, autophony, hyperacusis, tinnitus, vertigo, imbalance and sound-, pressure and exercise provoked dizziness. Secondary outcome measure: Correlations between changes of objective and subjective measures before and after surgery. RESULTS Patients who reported hearing loss had larger ABGs at 250 Hz than patients without subjective hearing loss (p = 0.001). ABGs and cVEMP thresholds did not correlate with any other symptom. No significant correlation was found between ABG or cVEMP threshold and the HHI, DHI, AI or Health Utility Value (derived from the SF-36 quality of life score). Following SCD surgery, ABG decreased (p {\textless} 0.001), cVEMP thresholds increased (p {\textless} 0.001) and overall symptoms, handicap scores and quality-of-life improved; however, there was no significant relationship between these measures. CONCLUSION While threshold audiometry and cVEMP are important tools to diagnose SCD and monitor surgical outcomes, these measures showed no significant correlation with vestibular and most auditory symptoms or their severity.},

Optogenetics has been proposed as a means to improve auditory implant outcomes by reducing channel interaction and increasing electrode density, but the introduction of opsins into cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in vivo has been challenging. Here we test opsin delivery using a synthetically developed ancestral adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector called Anc80L65. Wild-type C57BL/6 mouse pups were injected via the round window of cochlea with Anc80L65 carrying opsin Chronos under the control of a CAG promoter. Following an incubation of 6–22 weeks, pulsed blue light was delivered to cochlear SGNs via a cochleosotomy approach and flexible optical fiber. Optically evoked auditory brainstem responses (oABRs) and multiunit activity in inferior colliculus (IC) were observed. Post-experiment cochlear histology demonstrated opsin expression in SGNs (mean = 74\%), with an even distribution of opsin along the cochlear basal/apical gradient. This study is the first to describe robust SGN transduction, opsin expression, and optically evoked auditory electrophysiology in neonatal mice. Ultimately, this work may provide the basis for a new generation of cochlear implant based on light.},

Non-penetrating surface grids used in electrocorticography (ECoG) permit simultaneous recording of multiple cortical sites, with limited spatial resolution, due to distance to neuronal tissue, large contact size and high impedances. Here we compared new thin-film parylene C ECoG grids, covering the guinea pig primary auditory cortex, with simultaneous recordings from penetrating electrode array (PEAs), inserted through openings in the grid material. ECoG grid local field potentials (LFP) showed higher response thresholds and amplitudes compared to PEAs. They enabled, however, fast and reliable tonotopic mapping of the auditory cortex (place-frequency slope: 0.7 mm/octave), with tuning widths similar to PEAs. The ECoG signal correlated best with supragranular layers, exponentially decreasing with cortical depth. The grids also enabled recording of multi-unit activity (MUA), yielding several advantages over LFP recordings, including sharper frequency tunings. ECoG first spike latency showed highest similarity to superficial PEA contacts and MUA traces maximally correlated with PEA recordings from the granular layer. These results confirm high quality of the ECoG grid recordings and the possibility to collect LFP and MUA simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Current models of somatosensory perception emphasize transmission from primary sensory neurons to the spinal cord and on to the brain1–4. Mental influence on perception is largely assumed to occur locally within the brain. Here we investigate whether sensory inflow through the spinal cord undergoes direct top-down control by the cortex. Although the corticospinal tract (CST) is traditionally viewed as a primary motor pathway5, a subset of corticospinal neurons (CSNs) originating in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex directly innervate the spinal dorsal horn via CST axons. Either reduction in somatosensory CSN activity or transection of the CST in mice selectively impairs behavioural responses to light touch without altering responses to noxious stimuli. Moreover, such CSN manipulation greatly attenuates tactile allodynia in a model of peripheral neuropathic pain. Tactile stimulation activates somatosensory CSNs, and their corticospinal projections facilitate light-touch-evoked activity of cholecystokinin interneurons in the deep dorsal horn. This touch-driven feed-forward spinal–cortical–spinal sensitization loop is important for the recruitment of spinal nociceptive neurons under tactile allodynia. These results reveal direct cortical modulation of normal and pathological tactile sensory processing in the spinal cord and open up opportunities for new treatments for neuropathic pain.},

The bipolar configuration gave little reduction in spread, compared wpith a monopolar electrode, but the concentric configuration did reduce the extent of stimulus spread. The extent of spread depends greatly upon a number of experimental variables, including the dimensions of the microelectrode tip. For studies requiring precise localization with low stimulus currents, it is advisable to determine the inverse square law constant for each experimental situation. For more generalized stimulation purposes within the mammalian C.N.S., employing monopolar microelectrodes of moderate tip size, brief pulses of 10 muA can be expected to stimulate myelinated axons with about 0.15 mm of the tip, and 100 muA WILL Stimulate with a radius of about 0.5 mm.},

Both monopolar and concentric bipolar electrode configurations were tested with stimulating distances as large as 7 mm.

There was no statistically significant difference between the estimates of effective stimulation distance made using large and small axons. The shape of current-distance curves was approximately parabolic using both bipolar and monopolar stimulation. A current strength of 0.5 to 1.0 mA will confine effective current from a monopolar electrode to a sphere of 2-mm radius, but will not stimulate all elements within that area.

Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is an imaging method that can enable highly resolved mapping of electromagnetic tissue properties such as current density and conductivity of living tissues. In the current study, we experimentally imaged current density distribution of in vivo canine brains by applying MREIT to electrical stimulation. The current density maps of three canine brains were calculated from the measured magnetic flux density data. The absolute current density values of brain tissues, including gray matte...},

Here, we report that in rodents and human cadaver brains, {\textasciitilde}75\% of scalp-applied currents are attenuated by soft tissue and skull. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and subthreshold currents. We designed an ‘intersectional short pulse’ stimulation method to inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simultaneously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional protocols.},

In a typical in-vivo experiment, light is delivered to deep nuclei via an implanted optical fiber. Light intensity attenuates with increasing distance from the fiber tip, determining the volume of tissue in which optogenetic proteins can successfully be activated. However, whether and how this volume of effective light intensity varies as a function of brain region or wavelength has not been systematically studied. The goal of this study was to measure and compare how light scatters in different areas of the mouse brain. We delivered different wavelengths of light via optical fibers to acute slices of mouse brainstem, midbrain and forebrain tissue. We measured light intensity as a function of distance from the fiber tip, and used the data to model the spread of light in specific regions of the mouse brain. We found substantial differences in effective attenuation coefficients among different brain areas, which lead to substantial differences in light intensity demands for optogenetic experiments. The use of light of different wavelengths additionally changes how light illuminates a given brain area. We created a brain atlas of effective attenuation coefficients of the adult mouse brain, and integrated our data into an application that can be used to estimate light scattering as well as required light intensity for optogenetic manipulation within a given volume of tissue.},

The recorded local field potentials were subsequently evaluated using current source density (CSD) analysis to identify sources and sinks. Current sinks are thought to be an indicator of net synaptic current in the small volume of cortex surrounding the recording site. Thus, CSD analysis combined with multielectrode arrays enabled us to compare mean synaptic activity in response to small current stimuli on a layer-by-layer basis. We also used senescence-accelerated mice (SAM), some strains of which show earlier onset of age-related hearing loss, to examine the characteristic spatiotemporal CSD profiles stimulated by electrodes in specific cortical layers. Thus, the CSD patterns were classified into several clusters based on stimulation sites in the cortical layers. We also found some differences in CSD patterns between the two SAM strains in terms of aging according to principle component analysis with dimension reduction. For simultaneous two-site stimulation, we modeled the obtained CSD profiles as a linear superposition of the CSD profiles to individual single-site stimulation. The model analysis indicated the nonlinearity of spatiotemporal integration over stimulus-driven activity in a layer-specific manner. Finally, on the basis of these results, we discuss the auditory cortex local network properties and the effects of aging on these mouse strains.},

	abstract = {Current source density analysis assesses spatiotemporal synaptic activations at somatic and/or dendritic levels in the form of depolarizing current sinks. Whereas many studies have focused on the short ({\textless}50 ms) latency sinks, associated with thalamocortical projections, sinks with longer latencies have received less attention. Here we analyzed laminar current source density patterns for the first 600 ms after stimulus onset in the primary auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils. By applying an algorithm for contour calculation, three distinct mid and four late evoked sinks were identified in layers I, III, Va, VIa, and VIb. Our results further showed that the patterns of intracortical information-flow remained qualitatively similar for low and for high sound pressure level stimuli at the characteristic frequency (CF) as well as for stimuli ± 1 octave from CF. There were, however, differences associated with the strength, vertical extent, onset latency, and duration of the sinks for the four stimulation paradigms used. Stimuli one octave above the most sensitive frequency evoked a new, and quite reliable, sink in layer Va whereas low level stimulation led to the disappearance of the layer VIb sink. These data indicate the presence of input sources specifically activated in response to level and/or frequency parameters. Furthermore, spectral integration above vs. below the characteristic frequency of neurons is asymmetric as illustrated by current source density profiles. These results are important because synaptic feedback associated with mid and late sinks – beginning at 50 ms post stimulus latency – is likely crucial for response modulation resulting from higher order processes like memory, learning or cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Background—Current source density analysis of recordings from penetrating electrode arrays has traditionally been used to examine the layer-specific cortical activation and plastic changes associated with changed afferent input. We report on a related analysis, the second spatial derivative (SSD) of surface local field potentials (LFPs) recorded using custom designed thin-film polyimide substrate arrays. Results—SSD analysis of tone-evoked LFPs generated from the auditory cortex under the recording array demonstrated a stereotypical single local minimum, often flanked by maxima on both the caudal and rostral sides. In contrast, tone-pips at frequencies not represented in the region under the array, but known (on the basis of normal tonotopic organization) to be represented caudal to the recording array, had a more complex pattern of many sources and sinks. Comparison with Existing Methods—Compared to traditional analysis of LFPs, SSD analysis produced a tonotopic map that was more similar to that obtained with multi-unit recordings in a normal-hearing animal. Additionally, the statistically significant decrease in the number of acoustically responsive cortical locations in partially deafened cats following 6 months of cochlear implant use compared to unstimulated cases observed with multi-unit data (p = 0.04) was also observed with SSD analysis (p = 0.02), but was not apparent using traditional analysis of LFPs (p = 0.6). Conclusions—SSD analysis of surface LFPs from the thin-film array provides a rapid and robust method for examining the spatial distribution of cortical activity with improved spatial resolution compared to more traditional LFP recordings.

Modeling enables efficient exploration of large parameter spaces, where preclinical and clinical studies would be infeasible. Current commercial finite element method software packages enable straightforward calculation of the potential distributions, but it is not always clear how to implement boundary conditions to appropriately represent metal stimulating electrodes. By quantifying the effects of different electrode representations on activation thresholds for model axons, we provide recommendations for accurate and efficient modeling of neural stimulating electrodes. Methods: We quantified the effects of different representations of current sources for neural stimulation in COMSOL Multiphysics for monopolar, bipolar, and multipolar electrode designs. Results: We recommend modeling each electrode contact as a thin platinum domain, modeling the electrode substrate with the conductivity of silicone, and either using a point current source in the center of each electrode contact or using a boundary current source. Alternatively, to avoid possible numerical instabilities associated with a large range of conductivity values (i.e., platinum and silicone) and to eliminate the small mesh elements required for thin electrode contacts, the electrode substrate can be assigned the conductivity of platinum by using insulating boundaries between the substrate and surrounding medium, and within the substrate to isolate the contacts from each other. When modeling more than one contact, we recommend using superposition by solving the model once for each contact, leaving inactive contacts floating, and superposing the resulting potentials. We computed comparable errors in activation thresholds across the different implementations in a simplified model (electrode in a homogeneous, isotropic medium), and in realistic models of rat spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and human deep brain stimulation, indicating that the recommended approaches are applicable to different stimulation targets.},

	abstract = {Cochlear Implants (CIs) are medical implantable devices that can restore the sense of hearing in people with profound hearing loss. Clinical trials assessing speech intelligibility in CI users have found large intersubject variability. One possibility to explain the variability is the individual differences in the interface created between electrodes of the CI and the auditory nerve. In order to understand the variability, models of the voltage distribution of the electrically stimulated cochlea may be useful. With this purpose in mind, we developed a parametric model that can be adapted to each CI user based on landmarks from individual cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of the cochlea before and after implantation. The conductivity values of each cochlea compartment as well as the weighting factors of different grounding modes have also been parameterized. Simulations were performed modeling the cochlea and electrode positions of 12 CI users. Three models were compared with different levels of detail: a homogeneous model (HM), a non-patient-specific model (NPSM), and a patient-specific model (PSM). The model simulations were compared with voltage distribution measurements obtained from the backward telemetry of the 12 CI users. Results show that the PSM produces the lowest error when predicting individual voltage distributions. Given a patient-specific geometry and electrode positions, we show an example on how to optimize the parameters of the model and how to couple it to an auditory nerve model. The model here presented may help to understand speech performance variability and support the development of new sound coding strategies for CIs.},

The 3D atlases available so far have been created using frameworks which make it difficult for other researchers to replicate the results. To facilitate reproducible research and data sharing in the field we propose an SVG-based Common Atlas Format (CAF) to store 2D atlas delineations or other compatible data and 3D Brain Atlas Reconstructor (3dBAR), software dedicated to automated reconstruction of three-dimensional brain structures from 2D atlas data. The basic functionality is provided by (1) a set of parsers which translate various atlases from a number of formats into the CAF, and (2) a module generating 3D models from CAF datasets. The whole reconstruction process is reproducible and can easily be configured, tracked and reviewed, which facilitates fixing errors. Manual corrections can be made when automatic reconstruction is not sufficient. The software was designed to simplify interoperability with other neuroinformatics tools by using open file formats. The content can easily be exchanged at any stage of data processing. The framework allows for the addition of new public or proprietary content.},

	abstract = {Background: Hearing performance varies greatly among users of cochlear implants. Current three- dimensional cochlear models that predict the electrical fields inside a stimulated cochlea and their effect on neural excitation are generally based on a generic human or guinea pig cochlear shape that does not take inter-user morphological variations into account. This precludes prediction of user- specific performance. Aims: The aim of this study is to develop a model of the implanted cochlea of a specific living hu- man individual and to assess if the inclusion of morphological variations in cochlear models affects predicted outcomes significantly. Methods: Five three-dimensional electric volume conduction models of the implanted cochleae of individual living users were constructed from standard CT scan data. These models were embedded in head models that include monopolar return electrodes in accurate anatomic positions. Potential distributions and neural excitation patterns were predicted for each of the models. Results: Modeled potential distributions and neural excitation profiles (threshold amplitudes, center frequencies, and bandwidths) are affected by user-specific cochlear morphology and electrode placement within the cochlea. Conclusions: This work suggests that the use of user-specific models is indicated when more detailed analysis is required than what is available from generic models.

	abstract = {The role of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) in directional hearing was evaluated by measuring sound localization behaviors before and after cats received lesions of the dorsal and intermediate acoustic striae (DAS/IAS). These lesions are presumed to disrupt spectral processing in the DCN without affecting binaural time and level difference cues that exit the cochlear nucleus via the ventral acoustic stria. Prior to DAS/IAS lesions, cats made accurate head orientation responses toward sound sources in the frontal sound field. After a unilateral DAS/IAS lesion, subjects showed increased errors in the azimuth and elevation of their responses; in addition, the final orientation of head movements tended to be more variable. Largest deficits in response elevation were observed in the hemifield that was ipsilateral to the lesion. When a second lesion was placed in the opposite DAS/IAS, increased orientation errors were observed throughout the frontal field. Nonetheless, bilaterally lesioned cats showed normal discrimination of changes in sound source location when tested with a spatial acuity task. These findings support previous interpretations that the DCN contributes to sound orientation behavior, and further suggest that the identification of absolute sound source locations and the discrimination between spatial locations involve independent auditory processing mechanisms.

A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P {\textless} 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.},

	abstract = {Neural interface technology has made enormous strides in recent years but stimulating electrodes remain incapable of reliably targeting specific cell types (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory neurons) within neural tissue. This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is genetically targetable, specific populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the first in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface (ONI) in intact animals, involving integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 mW of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, flexible multimode optical fiber, approximately 200 microm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we specifically targeted ChR2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the CaMKIIalpha promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the fiber ( approximately 380 mW mm(-2)) was sufficient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial finding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may find application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.},

	abstract = {1. Encoding temporal features of the acoustic waveform is an important attribute of the auditory system. Auditory nerve (AN) fibers synchronize or phase-lock to low-frequency tones and transmit this temporal information to cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). Phase-locking in the AVCN is usually reported to be similar to or weaker than in the AN. We studied phase-locking in axons of the trapezoid body (TB), which is the output tract of the AVCN, and found, to our surprise, that most TB axons exhibited enhanced synchronization compared with AN fibers. 2. Responses from axons in the TB of the cat were obtained with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- or Neurobiotin-filled micropipettes or metal microelectrodes. A series of short tone bursts at increasing sound pressure level (SPL) was presented at the characteristic frequency (CF) of the fiber and phase-locking was quantified with the vector strength R at each SPL. For each fiber the maximum R value (Rmax) was then determined. 3. Low-frequency fibers in the TB showed very precise phase-locking: Rmax values could approach 0.99. For the majority of fibers (33/44, 75\%) with CF {\textless} 700 Hz, Rmax was {\textgreater} or = 0.9 and therefore higher than is ever observed in the AN. We define such fibers as "high-sync." Most of these fibers also entrained to the stimulus, i.e., they fired a precisely timed action potential to almost every stimulus cycle. Some fibers showed perfect entrainment, with maximum discharge rates equaling the stimulus frequency. 4. To exclude the possibility that stimulus paradigms or acoustic and recording equipment were the source of this enhancement, we obtained additional data on low-frequency AN fibers using the same experimental protocol as in our TB experiments. These AN data agree well with published reports. 5. The morphological class of some of the cells studied was identified on the basis of anatomic features revealed by intra-axonal injection of HRP or Neurobiotin. Labeled low-CF axons (N = 7), which were all high-sync, originated from AVCN bushy cells: five were globular and two were spherical bushy cell axons. 6. Spontaneous rate of high-sync fibers covered a range from 0 to 176 spikes/s but were biased toward low values (mean 16 spikes/s). Responses to broadband clicks and sinusoidally amplitude-modulated signals provided additional evidence of improved timing properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Prior knowledge regarding the expected latencies and amplitudes of the various peaks is then used to incrementally label peaks I through to VII. The performance of the algorithm is estimated on a set of 240 ABR waveforms captured at a stimulus intensity of 90dBnHL. The proposed algorithm not only offers insight into the manual process of ABR peak detection, but is shown to be extremely accurate (96-98\%) at finding the primary peaks of clinical interest (I, III, and V). It is also shown that although peak IV can only be found with moderate accuracy (77\%), almost one third of these correct detections come as a direct result of locating the "peak" using the second derivative. © 2004 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the cat ventral cochlear nucleus, separate neuronal classes have been defined based on morphological characteristics; physiologically defined unit types have also been described based on the shape of post-stimulus-time-histograms in response to tone bursts at characteristic frequency. The aim of the present study was to address directly the issue of how morphological cell types relate to physiological unit types. We used intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase to stain individual neurons after their response characteristics were determined by intracellular recordings. The maintenance of a continuous negative resting potential, the correspondence of the calculated position of the electrode tip at the time of injection to the location of the stained neuron, and the similarity of response properties collected before and after the injection provide evidence that the injected, stained, and recovered neuron corresponds to the functionally defined unit. In the region around the nerve root in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, two " primarylike " and one " primarylike with notch" units were "bushy" cells. "Bushy" cells are characterized by primary dendrites arising from one hemisphere of the soma and ramifying repeatedly to produce their bushy dendritic arbor. In this same region, the "chopper" and two "on" units were also "bushy" cells. In the posteroventral cochlear nucleus, the "chopper" unit was a "stellate" cell and the "on" unit was an "octopus" cell. These results are partially consistent with previous conclusions based on correlations established between the regional distribution of physiological unit types and morphological cell types. More importantly, they confirm and extend recent intracellular marking data (Rhode et al., ' 83b ). If our classification schemes have functional significance, we are left with the conclusion that the distinction between "bushy" and "stellate" cells in the auditory nerve root region of the ventral cochlear nucleus does not correspond in any simple way to distinctions between physiological unit types. More than one morphological cell type can exhibit the same particular response patter, and the same morphological cell type can exhibit several different response patterns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Repair of superior canal dehiscence (SCD) often results in the resolution of preoperative auditory and vestibular symptoms; however, many patients experience dizziness in the postoperative period. Postoperative dizziness may be the result of new-onset benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This study aims to investigate the prevalence of BPPV before and following SCD repair. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Electronic medical records were reviewed for patients with a diagnosis of SCD syndrome (SCDS) between January 2002 and May 2015. Collected information included demographic data, incidence of BPPV diagnosed by Dix-Hallpike maneuver before and following surgery, operative technique, repair material, and the duration of time to BPPV onset. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients with a diagnosis of SCDS were identified: 84 patients underwent surgery (operated subjects) and 96 were observed (nonoperated, control group). In operated subjects, 20 of 84 (23.8\%) developed BPPV following SCD repair versus 6.2\% of nonoperated (P {\textless} 0.005). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo lateralized to the operated side in all but one subject whose laterality was unknown (P {\textless} 0.0001). There were no associations of BPPV with surgical approach (P = 0.50) or repair material (P = 0.33). The majority of subjects (58\%) were diagnosed with BPPV within 3 months of surgery. CONCLUSION: New-onset BPPV occurs commonly after SCD repair and may be the result of mobilized otoliths from inner ear pressure changes. Although the exact etiology of post-SCD repair BPPV remains unknown, postoperative dizziness is important to discuss with patients during preoperative counseling. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

	abstract = {1. We have recorded the responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats to the synthetic, steady-state-vowel sound /e/, presented over a range of stimulus intensities. 2. The responses of (putative) spherical bushy cells [primary-like (Pri) units] to the vowel resemble those of auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs) in terms of both rate and temporal encoding at low and moderate stimulus levels. It was not possible to study the responses of most Pri units at the highest stimulus level because of the large neurophonic component present in recordings from most primarylike units at higher stimulus levels. 3. The responses of many (putative) globular bushy cells [primarylike with notch (PN) units] to the vowel resemble those of ANFs; however, there appears to be greater heterogeneity in the responses of units in the PN population than in the Pri population in terms of both temporal and rate encoding. 4. Populations of stellate cells (chopper units) have degraded representations of the temporal information in ANF population discharge patterns in response to the vowel; this is consistent with the responses of these units to pure tones. Both regular (ChS) and irregular (ChT) chopper subpopulations, however, maintain better rate-place representations of the vowel spectrum than does the population of ANFs as a whole. The rate-place representations of the vowel spectrum by both chopper populations closely resemble those of low and medium spontaneous rate ANFs at most stimulus levels. 5. The data presented in this paper suggest that a functional partition of the AVCN chopper population could yield two distinct rate representations in response to a complex stimulus: one that is graded with stimulus level (over a 30 to 40 dB range) and that, even at rate saturation, maintains a "low contrast" stimulus representation; and a second that maintains a robust, "high contrast" stimulus representation at all levels but that confers less information about stimulus level.},

	abstract = {1. The responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats are characterized with regard to features of their responses to short tone bursts (STBs; 25 ms). A "decision tree" is presented to partition AVCN units on the basis of post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) shape, first spike latency, and discharge rate and regularity calculated as functions of time during responses to STBs. The major classes of AVCN units (primary-like, primary-like-with-notch, chopper, and onset) have been described previously; in this paper, special attention is given to clarifying and systematizing boundaries between classes. Certain types of "unusual" units that may be confused with units in one of the major classes are also examined. 2. When STBs are presented synchronously (constant phase at onset), PSTHs of responses to very-low-frequency (less than 1.0 kHz) tones are difficult if not impossible to resolve into the classes listed above because all unit types phase-lock to low-frequency tones. However, when STBs are presented asynchronously, the responses of units with low best frequencies can be categorized on the basis of PSTH shape and first spike latency. 3. Primary-like, primary-like-with-notch, and onset units are distinguished primarily on the basis of PSTH shape. These three unit types have comparable minimum first spke latencies and synchronization to tones. One type of "unusual" response poses a particular hazard with respect to the generation of uncontaminated primary-like populations. Such "unusual" units have PSTHs that appear primary-like; these units are, however, distinguished by their unusually long first spike latencies. Unlike primary-like units, these "unusual" units show extremely poor synchronization to tones. 4. Chopper units are defined as having an initial response that is highly regular, resulting in the characteristic multimodal PSTH. "Unusual" units with multimodal PSTHs but whose initial responses are not highly regular (measured by the reproducibility of the initial firing pattern in response to multiple repetitions of a STB) are eliminated from the chopper populations. 5. In barbiturate-anesthetized cats, at least three patterns of chopper response can be distinguished on the basis of temporal patterns of rate and regularity adaptation. "Sustained" choppers show no adaptation of instantaneous rate (measured by the inverse of the mean interspike interval), and their discharge remains highly regular throughout the response. "Transiently adapting" choppers undergo a very rapid (less than 10 ms) decrease in instantaneous rate accompanied by a sharp increase in discharge irregularity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Objectives: Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) may be the only opportunity for patients with NF2 to regain some sense of hearing sensation. However, only a very small number of individuals achieved open-set speech understanding and high sentence scores. Suboptimal placement of the ABI electrode array over the cochlear nucleus may be one of main factors for poor auditory performance. In the current study, we present a method of awake craniotomy to assist with ABI placement. Methods: Awake surgery and hearing test via the retrosigmoid approach were performed for vestibular schwannoma resections and auditory brainstem implantations in four patients with NF2. Auditory outcomes and complications were assessed postoperatively. Results: Three of 4 patients who underwent awake craniotomy during ABI surgery received reproducible auditory sensations intraoperatively. Satisfactory numbers of effective electrodes, threshold levels and distinct pitches were achieved in the wake-up hearing test. In addition, relatively few electrodes produced non-auditory percepts. There was no serious complication attributable to the ABI or awake craniotomy. Conclusions: It is safe and well tolerated for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients using awake craniotomy during auditory brainstem implantation. This method can potentially improve the localization accuracy of the cochlear nucleus during surgery.Copyright © 2018 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).},

Cadavers have also proven instrumental for the measurement of artifacts and nonneural effects in functional imaging, and more recently, the study of biophysical properties critical to brain stimulation. However, death produces significant changes in the biophysical properties of brain tissues, making an ex vivo to in vivo compar-ison complex, and even questionable. This study directly compares biophysical properties of electric fields arising from transcranial electric stimulation (TES) in a nonhuman primate brain pre-and postmortem. We show that pre-vs. postmortem, TES-induced intracranial electric fields differ significantly in both strength and frequency response dynamics, even while controlling for con-founding factors such as body temperature. Our results clearly indicate that ex vivo cadaver and in vivo measurements are not easily equitable.

	abstract = {Developmental changes that influence the results of removal of afferent input on the survival of neurons of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of mice were examined with the hope of providing a suitable model for understanding the cellular and molecular basis for these developmental changes in susceptibility. We performed unilateral cochlear ablation on wild-type mice at a variety of ages around the time of hearing onset to determine developmental changes in the sensitivity of AVCN neurons to afferent deprivation. In postnatal day 5 (P5) mice, cochlea removal resulted in 61\% neuronal loss in the AVCN. By age P14, fewer than 1\% of AVCN neurons were lost after this manipulation. This reveals a rather abrupt change in the sensitivity to disruption of afferent input, a critical period. We next investigated the temporal events associated with neuron loss after cochlea removal in susceptible animals. We demonstrate that significant cell loss occurs within 48 hours of cochlea removal in P7 animals. Furthermore, evidence of apoptosis was observed within 12 hours of cochlea removal, suggesting that the molecular events leading to cell loss after afferent deprivation begin to occur within hours of cochlea removal. Finally, we began to examine the role of the bcl-2 gene family in regulating afferent deprivation-induced cell death in the mouse AVCN. AVCN neurons in mature bcl-2 knockout mice demonstrate susceptibility to removal of afferent input comparable to neonatal sensitivity of wild-type controls. These data suggest that bcl-2 is one effector of cell survival as these cells switch from afferent-dependent to -independent survival mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Speech recognition was measured as a function of spectral resolution (number of spectral channels) and speech-to-noise ratio in normal-hearing (NH) and cochlear-implant (CI) listeners. Vowel, consonant, word, and sentence recognition were measured in five normal-hearing listeners, ten listeners with the Nucleus-22 cochlear implant, and nine listeners with the Advanced Bionics Clarion cochlear implant. Recognition was measured as a function of the number of spectral channels (noise bands or electrodes) at signal-to-noise ratios of + 15, + 10, +5, 0 dB, and in quiet. Performance with three different speech processing strategies (SPEAK, CIS, and SAS) was similar across all conditions, and improved as the number of electrodes increased (up to seven or eight) for all conditions. For all noise levels, vowel and consonant recognition with the SPEAK speech processor did not improve with more than seven electrodes, while for normal-hearing listeners, performance continued to increase up to at least 20 channels. Speech recognition on more difficult speech materials (word and sentence recognition) showed a marginally significant increase in Nucleus-22 listeners from seven to ten electrodes. The average implant score on all processing strategies was poorer than scores of NH listeners with similar processing. However, the best CI scores were similar to the normal-hearing scores for that condition (up to seven channels). CI listeners with the highest performance level increased in performance as the number of electrodes increased up to seven, while CI listeners with low levels of speech recognition did not increase in performance as the number of electrodes was increased beyond four. These results quantify the effect of number of spectral channels on speech recognition in noise and demonstrate that most CI subjects are not able to fully utilize the spectral information provided by the number of electrodes used in their implant.},

	abstract = {New silicon technology is enabling large-scale electrophysiological recordings in vivo from hundreds to thousands of channels. Interpreting these recordings re-quires scalable and accurate automated methods for spike sorting, which should minimize the time required for manual curation of the results. Here we introduce KiloSort, a new integrated spike sorting framework that uses template matching both during spike detection and during spike clustering. KiloSort models the electrical voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, which allows overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Unlike previous algorithms that compress the data with PCA, KiloSort operates on the raw data which allows it to construct a more accurate model of the waveforms. Processing times are faster than in previous algorithms thanks to batch-based optimization on GPUs. We compare KiloSort to an established algorithm and show favorable performance, at much reduced processing times. A novel post-clustering merg-ing step based on the continuity of the templates further reduced substantially the number of manual operations required on this data, for the neurons with near-zero error rates, paving the way for fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings.},

Data were recorded in response to pure tones from 141 and 193 multiunit clusters in the rat VCN and the CIC, respectively. Of 141 VCN sites, 126 were individually stimulated while recording responses in the CIC. A variety of CIC response types were seen with an increase in both electrical and acoustic stimulation levels. The majority of sites exhibited monotonic rate-level types acoustically, whereas spike rate saturation was achieved predominantly with electrical stimulation. In 20.6\% of the 364 characteristic frequency aligned VCN-CIC pairs, the CIC sites did not respond to stimulation. In 26\% of the 193 CIC sites, a high correlation was observed between acoustic tuning and electrical tuning obtained through VCN stimulation. A high degree of frequency specificity was found in 58\% of the 118 lowest threshold VCN-CIC pairs. This was dependent on electrode placement within the VCN because a higher degree of frequency specificity was achieved with stimulation of medial, central, and posterolateral VCN regions than more anterolateral regions. Broadness of acoustic tuning in the CIC played a role in frequency-specific activation. Narrowly tuned CIC sites showed the lowest degree of frequency specificity on stimulation of the anterolateral VCN regions. These data provide significant implications for auditory brain stem implant electrode placement, current localization, power requirements, and facilitation of information transfer to higher brain centers.},

The nuclear sizes relative to the total of subcortical auditory tissue were normalized and then analyzed individually for statistically reliable deviations. The overall form of the entire system of ten nuclei and two nuclear subsystems (cochlear nuclei, superior olives) were also analyzed for similarities and notable deviations among the animals. The results show that the absolute size of the auditory system varies more than 139-fold among the 53 mammals (with moles the smallest and humans the largest). Log auditory system volume and log brain weight are closely correlated (r=0.903, p {\textless}0.0001). Bats, kangaroo rats, marmosa opossums, and Norway rats have the largest auditory systems relative to their brain size, while humans have the smallest by far. The other primates also have auditory system/brain size ratios smaller than the sample average, suggesting that the condition in humans is one result of an expansion of non-auditory brain parts rather than a reduction of the auditory system over geological time. The relative sizes of the ten nuclei are well ordered, with the inferior colliculus the largest nucleus by far and medial superior olive the smallest. Because the size of the superior olives, collectively, is reliably related to the size of anteroventral cochlear nucleus (r=0.744, p {\textless}0.001), and not to the size of dorsal cochlear nucleus, the interconnectivity of the subcortical auditory system is probably a factor in the size of the nuclei. In its overall form, the subcortical auditory system is highly similar among mammals, with an average correlation across nuclei of 0.923. This high value means that the overall form of the system has been relatively stable over geological time. The animals with least deviation from the average form are ring-tailed possums, bandicoots, and yellow-bellied gliders, all marsupials. Those with the most unusual forms are mice, bats, and kangaroo rats, all placentals.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Nearly perfect speech recognition was observed under conditions of greatly reduced spectral information. Temporal envelopes of speech were extracted from broad frequency bands and were used to modulate noises of the same bandwidths. This manipulation preserved temporal envelope cues in each band but restricted the listener to severely degraded information on the distribution of spectral energy. The identification of con-sonants, vowels, and words in simple sentences improved markedly as the number of bands increased; high speech recognition performance was obtained with only three bands of modulated noise. Thus, the presentation of a dynamic temporal pattern in only a few broad spectral regions is sufficient for the recognition of speech. The recognition of speech has been thought to require frequency-specific (spec-tral) cues. Spectral energy peaks in speech (formants), for example, reflect the reso-nant properties of the vocal tract and thus provide acoustic information on the pro-duction of the speech sound. However, ef-forts to identify acoustic cues that convey phoneme identity reliably under various lis-tening conditions and with various talkers have met with only limited success (1). Studies that used amplitude compression (2) and spectral reduction (3) have demon-strated the robustness of speech recognition under these conditions. However, these ma-nipulations resulted in stimuli that were still highly complex in their temporal-spec-tral characteristics. Even total removal of spectral cues from speech resulted in stimuli that carried a surprising amount of informa-tion on consonant identity (4). Work on prosthetic electrical stimulation of the au-ditory system by cochlear implants has re-focused attention on amplitude and tempo-ral cues, which are the principal cues trans-mitted by these prostheses (5). In our study, we preserved amplitude and temporal cues while systematically varying the amount of spectral information. This combination not only allowed us to parametrically assess the role of spectral detail in speech recognition independently of temporal cues, but also simulates the stimulation pattern of a co-chlear implant (6). Spectral information was removed from speech by replacement of the frequency-specific information in a broad frequency region with a band-limited noise (Fig. 1). The acoustic signal was divided into several frequency bands and the amplitude enve-lope was extracted from each band by half-wave rectification and low-pass filtering.},

Pulsed INS, delivered to the surface of the cochlear nucleus via an optical fiber, evoked broad neural activation in the inferior colliculus. Strongest responses were recorded when the fiber was placed at lateral positions on the cochlear nucleus, close to the temporal bone. INS-evoked ABRs were multipeaked but longer in latency than those for electric stimulation; they resembled the responses to acoustic stimulation. After deafening, responses to electric stimulation persisted, whereas those to INS disappeared, consistent with a reported "optophonic" effect, a laser-induced acoustic artifact. Thus, for deaf individuals who use the auditory brainstem implant, INS alone did not appear promising as a new approach.},

We further show specific photoactivation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in behaving ChR2-EYFP reporter mice. The robust, consistent and inducible nature of our ChR2 mice represents a significant advance over previous lines, and the Arch-ER2 and eNpHR3.0 mice are to our knowledge the first demonstration of successful conditional transgenic optogenetic silencing.

	abstract = {To understand how auditory information is processed in the cochlear nuclei, it is crucial to know what circuitry exists and how it functions. Previous anatomical experiments have shown that neurons in the deep layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) project topographically to the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) (Wickesberg and Oertel, 1988). Because interneurons in the DCN and their targets in AVCN are excited by the same group of auditory nerve fibers, the projection is frequency-specific. Here we report that microinjections of glutamate in the DCN evoke trains of IPSPs in individual, impaled AVCN neurons in brain slices of the cochlear nuclear complex. Only injections along a rostrocaudal band in the DCN, matching the anatomical projection of tuberculoventral neurons, evoke IPSPs; elsewhere, there were no responses to the glutamate. The inhibition is blocked by 0.5 microM strychnine. Both bushy and stellate cells are targets of the inhibitory projection. Inhibition in the AVCN is delayed by an additional synaptic delay with respect to the excitation. Delayed, frequency-specific inhibition allows the first wavefront to be transmitted to higher auditory centers by bushy and stellate cells, while following inputs encoding signals of similar frequencies are attenuated at least for the duration of an IPSP. These findings are consistent with results from psychoacoustic experiments and suggest that this circuit provides a source of monaural echo suppression.},

	abstract = {This article investigates whether prediction of subject-specific physiological data is viable through an individualised computational model of a cochlear implant. Subject-specific predictions could be particularly useful to assess and quantify the peripheral factors that cause inter-subject variations in perception. The results of such model predictions could potentially be translated to clinical application through optimisation of mapping parameters for individual users, since parameters that affect perception would be reflected in the model structure and parameters. A method to create a subject-specific computational model of a guinea pig with a cochlear implant is presented. The objectives of the study are to develop a method to construct subject-specific models considering translation of the method to in vivo human models and to assess the effectiveness of subject-specific models to predict peripheral neural excitation on subject level. Neural excitation patterns predicted by the model are compared with single-fibre electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses obtained from the inferior colliculus in the same animal. Results indicate that the model can predict threshold frequency location, spatial spread of bipolar and tripolar stimulation and electrode thresholds relative to one another where electrodes are located in different cochlear structures. Absolute thresholds and spatial spread using monopolar stimulation are not predicted accurately. Improvements to the model should address this. © 2012 IPEM.},

If the cochlear nerve is not preserved during tumor removal, the only hearing rehabilitation in these patients could be via an auditory brainstem implant (ABI). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case study and literature review. SETTING: Tertiary referral cranial base center. PATIENTS: In 24 NF2 patients, 25 ABIs were placed in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle after VS surgery via a translabyrinthine approach. RESULTS: In this series, a large range of results are observed: from open speech and use of the telephone to no ABI use, because of the poor sound identification ability. Of the 24 patients, 19 use their ABI on a daily basis, 4 are nonusers, and 1 died of NF2 progression. A multivariate analysis did not reveal a good predictor for ABI outcome. In literature, the results of ABI in NF2 are difficult to compare, and the overall outcome was poor compared with cochlear implantation results. CONCLUSION: Auditory brainstem implantation in NF2 patients directly after tumor removal is a safe procedure and the best means of hearing rehabilitation if the cochlear nerve is not preserved. The results in NF2 cases in the literature and these series are poor compared with cochlear implantation. If a cochlear implant is possible, it has the preference over an ABI, also in NF2. Nevertheless, the majority of the patients have benefit of the ABI during daily life particularly in combination with lip reading.},

	abstract = {Object. Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) has typically resulted in deafness after surgical removal of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Cochlear implants are generally ineffective for this kind of deafness because of the loss of continuity in the auditory nerve after tumor removal. The first auditory brainstem implant (ABI) in such a patient was performed in 1979 at the House Ear Institute, and this individual continues to benefit from electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus complex. In 1992, an advanced multichannel ABI was developed and a series of patients with NF2 received this implant to study the safety and efficacy of the device. Methods. At the time of first- or second-side VS removal, patients received an eight-electrode array applied to the surface of the cochlear nucleus within the confines of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle. The device was activated approximately 6 weeks after implantation, and patients were tested every 3 months for the 1st year after the initial stimulation, and annually thereafter. The protocol included a comprehensive battery of psychophysical and speech perception tests. Conclusions. The multichannel ABI proved to be effective and safe in providing useful auditory sensations in most patients with NF2. The ABI improved patients' ability to communicate compared with the lipreading-only condition, it allowed the detection and recognition of many environmental sounds, and in some cases it provided significant ability to understand speech by using just the sound from the ABI (with no lipreading cues). Its performance in most patients has continued to improve for up to 8 years after implantation.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: Patients with bilateral auditory nerve destruction may perceive some auditory input with auditory brainstem implants (ABIs). Despite technological developments and trials in new stimulation sites, hearing is very variable and of limited quality. The goal of this study was to identify advantageous and critical factors that influence the quality of auditory function, especially speech perception.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: The authors conducted a prospective study on ABI operations performed with the aid of multimodality neuromonitoring between 2005 and 2009 in 18 patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2. Outcome was evaluated by testing word recognition (monotrochee-polysyllabic word test at auditory-only mode [MTPa]) and open speech perception (Hochmair-Schulz-Moser [HSM] sentence test), both in pure auditory mode. The primary outcome was the HSM score at 24 months. The predictive meaning of general clinical data, tumor volume, number of active electrodes, duration of deafness, and early hearing data was examined.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In 16 successful ABI activations the average score for MTPa was 89\% (SD 13\%), and for HSM it was 41\% (SD 32\%) at 24 months. There were 2 nonresponders, 1 after radiosurgery and the other in an anatomical variant. Direct facial nerve reconstruction during the same surgery was followed by successful nerve recovery in 2 patients, with a simultaneous very good HSM result. Patients' age, tumor extension, and tumor volume were not negative predictors. There was an inverse relationship between HSM scores and deafness duration; 50\% or higher HSM scores were found only in patients with ipsilateral deafness duration up to 24 months. The higher the deafness sum of both sides, the less likely that any HSM score will be achieved (p = 0.034). In patients with total deafness duration of less than 240 months, higher numbers of active electrodes were significantly associated with better outcomes. The strongest cross-correlation was identified between early MTPa score at 3 months and 24-month HSM outcome.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: This study documents that open-set speech recognition in pure auditory mode is feasible in patients with ABIs. Large tumor volumes do not prevent good outcome. Positive preconditions are short ipsilateral and short bilateral deafness periods and high number of auditory electrodes. Early ability in pure auditory word recognition tests indicates long-term capability of open speech perception.},

	abstract = {The electrically evoked middle latency response (EMLR) is a potentially useful measure of activation of the auditory system by a cochlear prosthesis. The present study compared cochlear prosthesis thresholds determined using EMLR with thresholds determined for psychophysical detection and for spike activity in cortical neurons. In systemically deafened guinea pigs, the difference between EMLR and psychophysical threshold level varied, with differences ranging from -4.6 dB (EMLR threshold more sensitive) to +10.7 dB (psychophysical threshold more sensitive) across animals and phase durations. Threshold differences between EMLR and auditory cortex neural spike responses were similar in magnitude and range (-6 to +15 dB) to those seen for EMLR vs. psychophysical thresholds. These ranges are comparable to the behavioral operating range for a given condition. In 3 of 12 subjects, the EMLR was absent for some or all electrode configurations tested, even at levels well above the threshold for psychophysical detection or cortical neuronal response. These results suggest that neither the EMLR thresholds nor cortical neuronal spike thresholds are an adequate substitute for psychophysical measures of threshold. While not sufficient for use in place of psychophysical measures, EMLR threshold level is strongly correlated with psychophysical threshold level across subjects (R2=0.82). Interestingly, plots of thresholds vs. phase duration were roughly parallel for psychophysical and EMLR thresholds, in contrast to the divergence of psychophysical and more peripheral (e.g., electrically evoked auditory brainstem response) evoked neural threshold vs. phase duration functions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Speech understanding abilities vary widely among cochlear implant (CI) listeners. A potential source of this variability is the electrode-neuron interface (ENI), which includes peripheral factors such as electrode position and integrity of remaining spiral ganglion neurons. Suboptimal positioning of the electrode array has been associated with poorer speech outcomes; however, postoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans are often not available to clinicians. CT-estimated electrode-to-modiolus distance (distance from the inner wall of the cochlea) has been shown to account for some variability in behavioral thresholds. However, psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) may provide additional insight into site-specific variation in channel interaction. Thirteen unilaterally implanted adults with the Advanced Bionics HiRes90K device participated. Behavioral thresholds and PTCs were collected for all available electrodes with steered quadrupolar (sQP) configuration, using a modified threshold sweep procedure, used in Bierer et al. (Trends Hear 19:1-12, 2015). PTC bandwidths were quantified to characterize channel interaction across the electrode array, and tip shifts were assessed to identify possible contributions of neural dead regions. Broader PTC bandwidths were correlated with electrodes farther from the modiolus, but not correlated with sQP threshold, though a trend was observed. Both measures were affected by scalar location, and PTC tip shifts were observed for electrodes farther from the modiolus. sQP threshold was the only variable correlated with word recognition. These results suggest PTCs may be used as a site-specific measure of channel interaction that correlates with electrode position in some CI listeners.Copyright © 2018 Association for Research in Otolaryngology},

	abstract = {Children's performance on psychoacoustic tasks improves with age, but inadequate  auditory input may delay this maturation. Cochlear implant (CI) users receive a degraded auditory signal with reduced frequency resolution compared with normal, acoustic hearing; thus, immature auditory abilities may contribute to the variation among pediatric CI users' speech recognition scores. This study investigated relationships between age-related variables, spectral resolution, and vowel identification scores in prelingually deafened, early-implanted children with CIs compared with normal hearing (NH) children. All participants performed vowel identification and the Spectral-temporally Modulated Ripple Test (SMRT). Vowel stimuli for NH children were vocoded to simulate the reduced spectral resolution of CI hearing. Age positively predicted NH children's vocoded vowel identification scores, but time with the CI was a stronger predictor of vowel recognition and SMRT performance of children with CIs. For both groups, SMRT thresholds were related to vowel identification performance, analogous to previous findings in adults. Sequential information analysis of vowel feature perception indicated greater transmission of duration-related information compared with formant features in both groups of children. In addition, the amount of F2 information transmitted predicted SMRT thresholds in children with NH and with CIs. Comparisons between the two CIs of bilaterally implanted children revealed disparate task performance levels and information transmission values within the same child. These findings indicate that adequate auditory experience contributes to auditory perceptual abilities of pediatric CI users. Further, factors related to individual CIs may be more relevant to psychoacoustic task performance than are the overall capabilities of the child.},

The cortical image of a pure tone showed a restricted focus of activity along the tonotopic gradient. As the stimulus frequency was increased, the location of the activation focus shifted from rostral to caudal. When cochlear activation was broadened by increasing the stimulus level or bandwidth, the cortical image broadened. An artificial neural network algorithm was used to quantify the accuracy of center-frequency representation by small populations of cortical neurons. The artificial neural network identified stimulus center frequency based on single-trial spike counts at as few as ten sites. The performance of the artificial neural network under various conditions of stimulus level and bandwidth suggests that the accuracy of representation of center frequency is largely insensitive to changes in the width of cortical images.},

This study exploited speech acoustics to model regions of distorted CI frequency transmission to determine the perceptual consequences of suboptimal electrode-neuron interfaces. Normal hearing adults identified naturally spoken vowels and consonants after spectral information was manipulated through a noiseband vocoder: either (1) low-, middle-, or high-frequency regions of information were removed by zeroing the corresponding channel outputs, or (2) the same regions were distorted by splitting filter outputs to neighboring filters. These conditions simulated the detrimental effects of suboptimal CI electrode-neuron interfaces on spectral transmission. Vowel and consonant confusion patterns were analyzed with sequential information transmission, perceptual distance, and perceptual vowel space analyses. Results indicated that both types of spectral manipulation were equally destructive. Loss or distortion of frequency information produced similar effects on phoneme identification performance and confusion patterns. Consonant error patterns were consistently based on place of articulation. Vowel confusions showed that perceptions gravitated away from the degraded frequency region in a predictable manner, indicating that vowels can probe frequency-specific regions of spectral degradations.},

	abstract = {Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Channel interaction, the stimulation of overlapping populations of auditory neurons by distinct cochlear implant (CI) channels, likely limits the speech perception performance of CI users. This study examined the role of vocoder-simulated channel interaction in the ability of children with normal hearing (cNH) and adults with normal hearing (aNH) to recognize spectrally degraded speech. The primary aim was to determine the interaction between number of processing channels and degree of simulated channel interaction on phoneme identification performance as a function of age for cNH and to relate those findings to aNH and to CI users. DESIGN: Medial vowel and consonant identification of cNH (age 8-17 years) and young aNH were assessed under six (for children) or nine (for adults) different conditions of spectral degradation. Stimuli were processed using a noise-band vocoder with 8, 12, and 15 channels and synthesis filter slopes of 15 (aNH only), 30, and 60 dB/octave (all NH subjects). Steeper filter slopes (larger numbers) simulated less electrical current spread and, therefore, less channel interaction. Spectrally degraded performance of the NH listeners was also compared with the unprocessed phoneme identification of school-aged children and adults with CIs. RESULTS: Spectrally degraded phoneme identification improved as a function of age for cNH. For vowel recognition, cNH exhibited an interaction between the number of processing channels and vocoder filter slope, whereas aNH did not. Specifically, for cNH, increasing the number of processing channels only improved vowel identification in the steepest filter slope condition. Additionally, cNH were more sensitive to changes in filter slope. As the filter slopes increased, cNH continued to receive vowel identification benefit beyond where aNH performance plateaued or reached ceiling. For all NH participants, consonant identification improved with increasing filter slopes but was unaffected by the number of processing channels. Although cNH made more phoneme identification errors overall, their phoneme error patterns were similar to aNH. Furthermore, consonant identification of adults with CI was comparable to aNH listening to simulations with shallow filter slopes (15 dB/octave). Vowel identification of earlier-implanted pediatric ears was better than that of later-implanted ears and more comparable to cNH listening in conditions with steep filter slopes (60 dB/octave). CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of spectrally degraded phonemes improved when simulated channel interaction was reduced, particularly for children. cNH showed an interaction between number of processing channels and filter slope for vowel identification. The differences observed between cNH and aNH suggest that identification of spectrally degraded phonemes continues to improve through adolescence and that children may benefit from reduced channel interaction beyond where adult performance has plateaued. Comparison to CI users suggests that early implantation may facilitate development of better phoneme discrimination.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) programming is similar for all CI users despite limited understanding of the electrode-neuron interface (ENI). The ENI refers to the ability of each CI electrode to effectively stimulate target auditory neurons and is influenced by electrode position, neural health, cochlear geometry, and bone and tissue growth in the cochlea. Hearing history likely affects these variables, suggesting that the efficacy of each channel of stimulation differs between children who were implanted at young ages and adults who lost hearing and received a CI later in life. This study examined whether ENI quality differed between early-implanted children and late-implanted adults. Auditory detection thresholds and most comfortable levels (MCLs) were obtained with monopolar and focused electrode configurations. Channel-to-channel variability and dynamic range were calculated for both types of stimulation. Electrical field imaging data were also acquired to estimate levels of intracochlear resistance. Children exhibited lower average auditory perception thresholds and MCLs compared with adults, particularly with focused stimulation. However, neither dynamic range nor channel-to-channel threshold variability differed between groups, suggesting that children's range of perceptible current was shifted downward. Children also demonstrated increased intracochlear resistance levels relative to the adult group, possibly reflecting greater ossification or tissue growth after CI surgery. These results illustrate physical and perceptual differences related to the ENI of early-implanted children compared with late-implanted adults. Evidence from this study demonstrates a need for further investigation of the ENI in CI users with varying hearing histories.},

We tested the accuracy of coding of the place of stimulation (i.e., identification of the active stimulation channel) and of the stimulus current level. Physiological data came from the companion study, which recorded spike activity of neurons simultaneously from 16 sites along the tonotopic axis of the guinea pig's auditory cortex. In that study, cochlear electrical stimuli were presented to acutely deafened animals through a 6-electrode animal version of the 22-electrode Nucleus banded electrode array (Cochlear). Cochlear electrode configurations consisted of monopolar (MP), bipolar (BP + N) with N inactive electrodes between the active and return electrodes (0 {\textless} or = N {\textless} or = 3), tripolar (TP) with one active electrode and two flanking return electrodes, and common ground (CG) with one active electrode and as many as five return electrodes. In the present analysis, an artificial neural network was trained to recognize spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity in response to single presentations of particular stimuli and, thereby, to identify those stimuli. The accuracy of pair-wise discrimination of stimulation channels or of current levels was represented by the discrimination index, d', where d' = 1 was taken as threshold. In many cases, the threshold for discrimination of place of cochlear stimulation was {\textless} 0.75 mm, and the threshold for discrimination of current levels was {\textless} 1 dB. Cochlear electrode configurations varied in the accuracy with which they signaled to the auditory cortex the place of cochlear stimulation. The BP + N and TP configurations provided considerably greater sensitivity to place of stimulation than did the MP configuration. The TP configuration maintained accurate signaling of place of stimulation up to the highest current levels, whereas sensitivity was degraded at high current levels in BP + N configurations. Electrode configurations also varied in the dynamic range over which they signaled stimulus current level. Dynamic ranges were widest for the BP + 0 configuration and narrowest for the TP configuration. That is, the configuration that showed the most accurate signaling of cochlear place of stimulation (TP) showed the most restricted dynamic range for signaling of current level. These results suggest that the choice of the optimal electrode configuration for use by human cochlear-prosthesis users would depend on the particular demands of the speech-processing strategy that is to be employed.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) users have poor temporal pitch perception, as revealed by two key outcomes of rate discrimination tests: (i) rate discrimination thresholds (RDTs) are typically larger than the corresponding frequency difference limen for pure tones in normal hearing listeners, and (ii) above a few hundred pulses per second (i.e. the "upper limit" of pitch), CI users cannot discriminate further increases in pulse rate. Both RDTs at low rates and the upper limit of pitch vary across listeners and across electrodes in a given listener. Here, we compare across-electrode and across-subject variation in these two measures with the variation in performance on another temporal processing task, gap detection, in order to explore the limitations of temporal processing in CI users. RDTs were obtained for 4-5 electrodes in each of 10 Advanced Bionics CI users using two interleaved adaptive tracks, corresponding to standard rates of 100 and 400 pps. Gap detection was measured using the adaptive procedure and stimuli described by Bierer et al. (JARO 16:273-284, 2015), and for the same electrodes and listeners as for the rate discrimination measures. Pitch ranking was also performed using a mid-point comparison technique. There was a marginal across-electrode correlation between gap detection and rate discrimination at 400 pps, but neither measure correlated with rate discrimination at 100 pps. Similarly, there was a highly significant across-subject correlation between gap detection and rate discrimination at 400, but not 100 pps, and these two correlations differed significantly from each other. Estimates of low-rate sensitivity and of the upper limit of pitch, obtained from the pitch ranking experiment, correlated well with rate discrimination for the 100- and 400-pps standards, respectively. The results are consistent with the upper limit of rate discrimination sharing a common basis with gap detection. There was no evidence that this limitation also applied to rate discrimination at lower rates.},

In the present study, three metrics were applied to assess the quality of the electrode-neuron interface of individual cochlear implant channels: the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP), the estimation of electrode position using computerized tomography (CT), and behavioral thresholds using focused stimulation. The primary motivation of this approach is to evaluate the ECAP as a site-specific measure of the electrode-neuron interface in the context of two peripheral factors that likely contribute to degraded perception: large electrode-to-modiolus distance and reduced neural density. Ten unilaterally implanted adults with Advanced Bionics HiRes90k devices participated. ECAPs were elicited with monopolar stimulation within a forward-masking paradigm to construct channel interaction functions (CIF), behavioral thresholds were obtained with quadrupolar (sQP) stimulation, and data from imaging provided estimates of electrode-to-modiolus distance and scalar location (scala tympani (ST), intermediate, or scala vestibuli (SV)) for each electrode. The width of the ECAP CIF was positively correlated with electrode-to-modiolus distance; both of these measures were also influenced by scalar position. The ECAP peak amplitude was negatively correlated with behavioral thresholds. Moreover, subjects with low behavioral thresholds and large ECAP amplitudes, averaged across electrodes, tended to have higher speech perception scores. These results suggest a potential clinical role for the ECAP in the objective assessment of individual cochlear implant channels, with the potential to improve speech perception outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objectives—The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of a threshold measure, made with a restricted electrode configuration, to identify channels exhibiting relatively poor spatial selectivity. With a restricted electrode configuration, channel-to-channel variability in threshold may reflect variations in the interface between the electrodes and auditory neurons (i.e., nerve survival, electrode placement, tissue impedance). These variations in the electrode-neuron interface should also be reflected in psychophysical tuning curve measurements. Specifically, it is hypothesized that high single-channel thresholds obtained with the spatially focused partial tripolar electrode configuration are predictive of wide or tip-shifted psychophysical tuning curves. Design—Data were collected from five cochlear implant listeners implanted with the HiRes 90k cochlear implant (Advanced Bionics). Single-channel thresholds and most comfortable listening levels were obtained for stimuli that varied in presumed electrical field size by using the partial tripolar configuration, for which a fraction of current (σ) from a center active electrode returns through two neighboring electrodes and the remainder through a distant indifferent electrode. Forward-masked psychophysical tuning curves were obtained for channels with the highest, lowest, and median tripolar (σ=1 or 0.9) thresholds. The probe channel and level were fixed and presented with either the monopolar (σ=0) or a more focused partial tripolar (σ ≥ 0.55) configuration. The masker channel and level were varied while the configuration was fixed to σ = 0.5. A standard, three- interval, two-alternative forced choice procedure was used for thresholds and masked levels. Results—Single-channel threshold and variability in threshold across channels systematically increased as the compensating current, σ, increased and the presumed electrical field became more focused. Across subjects, channels with the highest single-channel thresholds, when measured with a narrow, partial tripolar stimulus, had significantly broader psychophysical tuning curves than the lowest threshold channels. In two subjects, the tips of the tuning curves were shifted away from the probe channel. Tuning curves were also wider for the monopolar probes than with partial tripolar probes, for both the highest and lowest threshold channels. Conclusions—These results suggest that single-channel thresholds measured with a restricted stimulus can be used to identify cochlear implant channels with poor spatial selectivity. Channels having wide or tip-shifted tuning characteristics would likely not deliver the appropriate spectral information to the intended auditory neurons, leading to suboptimal perception. As a clinical tool, quick identification of impaired channels could lead to patient-specific mapping strategies and result in improved speech and music perception.},

	abstract = {This study examined the interactions between electrical stimuli presented through two channels of a cochlear implant. Experiments were conducted in anesthetized guinea pigs. Multiunit spike activity recorded from the auditory cortex reflected the cumulative effects of electric field interactions in the cochlea as well as any neural interactions along the ascending auditory pathway. The cochlea was stimulated electrically through a 6-electrode intracochlear array. The stimulus on each channel was a single 80- micro s/phase biphasic pulse. Channel interactions were quantified as changes in the thresholds for elevation of cortical spike rates. Experimental parameters were interchannel temporal offset (0 to +/-2000 micro s), interelectrode cochlear spacing (1.5 or 2.25 mm), electrode configuration (monopolar, bipolar, or tripolar), and relative polarity between channels (same or inverted). In most conditions, presentation of a subthreshold pulse on one channel reduced the threshold for a pulse on a second channel. Threshold shifts were greatest for simultaneous pulses, but appreciable threshold reductions could persist for temporal offsets up to 640 micro s. Channel interactions varied strongly with electrode configuration: threshold shifts increased in magnitude in the order tripolar, bipolar, monopolar. Channel interactions were greater for closer electrode spacing. The results have implications for design of speech processors for cochlear implants.},

Threshold increased from monopolar to bipolar to tripolar stimulation and was most variable across channels with the tripolar configuration. Channel interaction, quantified by the shift in threshold between single- and two-channel stimulation, occurred for all three configurations but was largest for the monopolar and simultaneous conditions. The threshold shifts with simultaneous tripolar stimulation were slightly smaller than with bipolar and were not as strongly affected by the timing of the two channel stimulation as was monopolar. The subjects’ performances on clinical speech tests were correlated with channel-to-channel variability in tripolar threshold, such that greater variability was related to poorer performance.

	abstract = {Speech perception among cochlear implant (CI) listeners is highly variable. High degrees of channel interaction are associated with poorer speech understanding. Two methods for reducing channel interaction, focusing electrical fields, and deactivating subsets of channels were assessed by the change in vowel and consonant identification scores with different program settings. The main hypotheses were that (a) focused stimulation will improve phoneme recognition and (b) speech perception will improve when channels with high thresholds are deactivated. To select high-threshold channels for deactivation, subjects? threshold profiles were processed to enhance the peaks and troughs, and then an exclusion or inclusion criterion based on the mean and standard deviation was used. Low-threshold channels were selected manually and matched in number and apex-to-base distribution. Nine ears in eight adult CI listeners with Advanced Bionics HiRes90k devices were tested with six experimental programs. Two, all-channel programs, (a) 14-channel partial tripolar (pTP) and (b) 14-channel monopolar (MP), and four variable-channel programs, derived from these two base programs, (c) pTP with high- and (d) low-threshold channels deactivated, and (e) MP with high- and (f) low-threshold channels deactivated, were created. Across subjects, performance was similar with pTP and MP programs. However, poorer performing subjects (scoring?{\textless}?62\% correct on vowel identification) tended to perform better with the all-channel pTP than with the MP program (1?{\textgreater}?2). These same subjects showed slightly more benefit with the reduced channel MP programs (5 and 6). Subjective ratings were consistent with performance. These finding suggest that reducing channel interaction may benefit poorer performing CI listeners.},

Recordings were made from the primary auditory cortex (area A1) of ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs. The spatiotemporal pattern of neural spike activity was measured simultaneously across 16 cortical locations spanning approximately 2-3 octaves of the tonotopic axis. Such a pattern, averaged over 40 presentations of any particular stimulus, was defined as the "cortical image" of that stimulus. Acutely deafened guinea pigs were implanted with a 6-electrode animal version of the 22-electrode Nucleus banded electrode array (Cochlear). Cochlear electrode configurations consisted of monopolar (MP), bipolar (BP + N) with N inactive electrodes between the active and return electrodes (0 {\textless} or = N {\textless} or = 4), tripolar (TP) with one active electrode and two flanking return electrodes, and common ground (CG) with one active electrode and as many as five return electrodes. Cortical images typically showed a focus of maximum spike probability and minimum latency. Spike probabilities tended to decrease, and latencies tended to increase, with increasing cortical distance from that focus. Cortical images of TP stimuli were the most spatially compact, followed by BP + N images, and then MP images, which were the broadest. Images of CG stimuli were rather variable across animals and stimulus channels. The locations of cortical images shifted systematically from caudal to rostral as the cochlear place of stimulation changed from basal to apical. At the most sensitive cortical site for each condition, the dynamic ranges over which spike rates increased with increased current level were restricted to about 1-2 dB, regardless of configuration. Dynamic ranges tended to increase with increasing cortical distance from the most sensitive site. Electrode configurations that produced compact cortical images (e.g., TP and BP + 0) showed the greatest range of thresholds within each cortical image and the largest dynamic range at cortical sites removed from the most sensitive site.},

Recordings were made along the tonotopic axis of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized guinea pigs. The partial tripolar electrode configuration was used, which provided a systematic way to vary the tonotopic extent of ICC activation between monopolar (broad) and tripolar (narrow) extremes while maintaining the same peak of activation. The forward masking paradigm consisted of a 200-ms masker pulse train (1017 pulses per second) followed 10 ms later by a single-pulse probe stimulus; the current fraction of the probe was set to 0 (monopolar), 1 (tripolar), or 0.5 (hybrid), and the fraction of the masker was fixed at 0.5. Forward masking tuning profiles were derived from the amount of masking current required to just suppress the activity produced by a fixed-level probe. These profiles were sharper for more focused probe configurations, approximating the pattern of neural activity elicited by single (non- masked) pulses. The result helps to bridge the gap between previous findings in animals and recent psychophysical data. Keywords},

	abstract = {Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses for persons with severe or profound hearing loss who gain little benefit from hearing aid amplification. Although implants are capable of providing important spectral and temporal cues for speech perception, performance on speech tests is variable across listeners. Psychophysical measures obtained from individual implant subjects can also be highly variable across implant channels. This review discusses evidence that such variability reflects deviations in the electrode-neuron interface, which refers to an implant channel's ability to effectively stimulate the auditory nerve. It is proposed that focused electrical stimulation is ideally suited to assess channel-to-channel irregularities in the electrode-neuron interface. In implant listeners, it is demonstrated that channels with relatively high thresholds, as measured with the tripolar configuration, exhibit broader psychophysical tuning curves and smaller dynamic ranges than channels with relatively low thresholds. Broader tuning implies that frequency-specific information intended for one population of neurons in the cochlea may activate more distant neurons, and a compressed dynamic range could make it more difficult to resolve intensity-based information, particularly in the presence of competing noise. Degradation of both types of cues would negatively affect speech perception.},

Focused stimulation strategies should improve spectral resolution in cochlear implant users, but may also be more sensitive to local irregularities in the electrode-neuron interface. In this study, we develop a practical computer model of cochlear implant stimulation that can simulate neural activation in a simplified cochlear geometry and we relate the resulting patterns of neural activity to basic psychophysical measures. We examine how two types of local irregularities in the electrode-neuron interface, variations in spiral ganglion nerve density and electrode position within the scala tympani, affect the simulated neural activation patterns and how these patterns change with electrode configuration. The model shows that higher partial tripolar fractions activate more spatially restricted populations of neurons at all current levels and require higher current levels to excite a given number of neurons. We find that threshold levels are more sensitive at high partial tripolar fractions to both types of irregularities, but these effects are not independent. In particular, at close electrode-neuron distances, activation is typically more spatially localized which leads to a greater influence of neural dead regions.},

Virtual spectral sweeps across the electrode array were implemented in the tracking procedure via current steering, which divides the current between two adjacent electrodes and varies the proportion of current directed to each electrode. Overall, no systematic differences were found between threshold estimates with the new channel sweep procedure and estimates using the adaptive forced-choice procedure. Test-retest reliability for the thresholds from the sweep procedure was somewhat poorer than for thresholds from the forced-choice procedure. However, the new method was about 4 times faster for the same number of repetitions. Overall the reliability and speed of the new tracking procedure provides it with the potential to estimate thresholds in a clinical setting. Rapid methods for estimating thresholds could be of particular clinical importance in combination with focused stimulation techniques that result in larger threshold variations between electrodes.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) users usually exhibit marked across-electrode differences in detection thresholds with "focused" modes of stimulation, such as partial-tripolar (pTP) mode. This may reflect differences either in local neural survival or in the distance of the electrodes from the modiolus. To shed light on these two explanations, we compared stimulus-detection thresholds and gap-detection thresholds (GDTs) at comfortably loud levels for at least four electrodes in each of ten Advanced Bionics CI users, using 1031-pps pulse trains. The electrodes selected for each user had a wide range of stimulus-detection thresholds in pTP mode. We also measured across-electrode variations in both stimulus-detection and gap-detection tasks in monopolar (MP) mode. Both stimulus-detection and gap-detection thresholds correlated across modes. However, there was no significant correlation between stimulus-detection and gap-detection thresholds in either mode. Hence, gap-detection thresholds likely tap a source of across-electrode variation additional to, or different from, that revealed by stimulus-detection thresholds. Stimulus-detection thresholds were significantly lower for apical than for basal electrodes in both modes; this was only true for gap detection in pTP mode. Finally, although the across-electrode standard deviation in stimulus-detection thresholds was greater in pTP than in MP mode, the reliability of these differences--assessed by dividing the across-electrode standard deviation by the standard deviation across adaptive runs for each electrode--was similar for the two modes; this metric was also similar across modes for gap detection. Hence across-electrode differences can be revealed using clinically available MP stimulation, with a reliability comparable to that observed with focused stimulation.},

In order to identify the contributions of these two mechanisms to tone-on-tone masking, masked thresholds of auditory-nerve fibers were measured in anesthetized cats using the same stimulus paradigms and detection criteria as in psychophysics. Suppressive masking was identified by comparing thresholds for simultaneous masking with those for a nonsimultaneous masking technique resembling pulsation thresholds. These nonsimultaneous thresholds do not include the contribution of suppression to masking because suppression only occurs for stimuli that overlap in time. For each masker and signal frequency, the fibers with the lowest (or "best") masked thresholds had characteristic frequencies (CF) slightly on the opposite side of the masker frequency with respect to the signal frequency, consistent with the psychophysical phenomenon of off-frequency listening. Patterns of best masked thresholds against signal frequency resembled psychophysical masking patterns in that they showed a maximum for signal frequencies close to the masker, and a skew toward high frequencies. Masking was found to be both excitatory and suppressive, with the relative contribution of the two mechanisms depending on the frequency separation between signal and masker. Suppressive masking was large for signal frequencies well above the masker. For these conditions, simultaneous thresholds grew more rapidly with masker level than did nonsimultaneous thresholds, suggesting that the upward spread of masking is largely due to the growth of suppression rather than to that of excitation.},

	abstract = {1. The neural correlates of low pitches produced by complex tones were studied by analyzing temporal discharge patterns of auditory nerve fibers in Dial-anesthetized cats. In the previous paper it was observed that, for harmonic stimuli, the most frequent interspike interval present in the population of auditory nerve fibers always corresponded to the perceived pitch (predominant interval hypothesis). The fraction of these most frequent intervals relative to the total number of intervals qualitatively corresponded to strength (salience) of the low pitches that are heard. 2. This paper addresses the neural correlates of stimuli that produce more complex patterns of pitch judgments, such as shifts in pitch and multiple pitches. Correlates of pitch shift and pitch ambiguity were investigated with the use of harmonic and inharmonic amplitude-modulated (AM) tones varying either in carrier frequency or modulation frequency. Pitches estimated from the pooled interval distributions showed shifts corresponding to "the first effect of pitch shift" (de Boer's rule) that is observed psychophysically. Pooled interval distributions in response to inharmonic stimulus segments showed multiple maxima corresponding to the multiple pitches heard by human listeners (pitch ambiguity). 3. AM and quasi-frequency-modulated tones with low carrier frequencies produce very similar patterns of pitch judgments, despite great differences in their phase spectra and waveform envelopes. Pitches estimated from pooled interval distributions were remarkably similar for the two kinds of stimuli, consistent with the psychophysically observed phase invariance of pitches produced by sets of low-frequency components. 4. Trains of clicks having uniform and alternating polarities were used to investigate the relation between pitches associated with periodicity and those associated with click rate. For unipolar click trains, where periodicity and rate coincide, physiologically estimated pitches closely follow the fundamental period. This corresponds to the pitch at the fundamental frequency (F0) that is heard. For alternating click trains, where rate and periodicity do not coincide, physiologically estimated pitches always closely followed the fundamental period. Although these pitch estimates corresponded to periodicity pitches that are heard for F0s {\textgreater} 150 Hz, they did not correspond to the rate pitches that are heard for F0s {\textless} 150 Hz. The predominant interval hypothesis thus failed to predict rate pitch. 5. When alternating-polarity click trains are high-pass filtered, rate pitches are strengthened and can also be heard at F0s {\textgreater} 150 Hz. Pitches for high-pass-filtered alternating click trains were estimated from pooled responses of fibers with characteristic frequencies (CFs) {\textgreater} 2 kHz. Roughly equal numbers of intervals at 1/rate and 1/F0 were found for all F0s studied, from 80 to 160 Hz, producing pitch estimates consistent with the rate pitches that are heard after high-pass filtering. The existence region for rate pitch also coincided with the presence of clear periodicities related to the click rate in pooled peristimulus time histograms. These periodicities were strongest for ensembles of fibers with CFs {\textgreater} 2 kHz, where there is widespread synchrony of discharges across many fibers. 6. The "dominance region for pitch" was studied with the use of two harmonic complexes consisting of harmonics 3-5 of one F0 and harmonics 6-12 of another fundamental 20\% higher in frequency. When the complexes were presented individually, pitch estimates were always close to the fundamental of the complex. When the complexes were presented concurrently, pitch estimates always followed the fundamental of harmonics 3-5 for F0s of 150-480 Hz. For F0s of 125-150 Hz, pitch estimates followed one or the other fundamental, and for F0s {\textless} 125 Hz, pitch estimates followed the fundamental of harmonics 6-12. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

The temporal discharge patterns of auditory nerve fibers in Dial-anesthetized cats were studied in response to periodic complex acoustic waveforms that evoke pitches at their fundamental frequencies. Single-formant vowels, amplitude-modulated (AM) and quasi-frequency-modulated tones. AM noise, click trains, and other complex tones were utilized. Distributions of intervals between successive spikes ("1st-order intervals") and between both successive and nonsuccessive spikes ("all-order intervals") were computed from spike trains. Intervals from many fibers were pooled to estimate interspike interval distributions for the entire auditory nerve. Properties of these "pooled interspike interval distributions," such as the positions of interval peaks and their relative heights, were examined for correspondence to the psychophysical data on pitch frequency and pitch salience. 2. For a diverse set of complex stimuli and levels, the most frequent all-order interspike interval present in the pooled distribution corresponded to the pitch heard in psychophysical experiments. Pitch estimates based on pooled interval distributions (30-85 fibers, 100 stimulus presentations per fiber) were highly accurate (within 1\%) for harmonic stimuli that produce strong pitches at 60 dB SPL. 3. Although the most frequent intervals in pooled all-order interval distributions were very stable with respect to sound intensity level (40, 60, and 80 dB total SPL), this was not necessarily the case for first-order interval distributions. Because the low pitches of complex tones are largely invariant with respect to level, pitches estimated from all-order interval distributions correspond better to perception. 4. Spectrally diverse stimuli that evoke similar low pitches produce pooled interval distributions with similar most-frequent intervals. This suggests that the pitch equivalence of these different stimuli could result from central auditory processing mechanisms that analyze interspike interval patterns. 5. Complex stimuli that evoke strong or "salient" pitches produce pooled interval distributions with high peak-to-mean ratios. Those stimuli that evoke weak pitches produce pooled interval distributions with low peak-to-mean ratios. 6. Pooled interspike interval distributions for stimuli consisting of low-frequency components generally resembled the short-time auto-correlation function of stimulus waveforms. Pooled interval distributions for stimuli consisting of high-frequency components resembled the short-time autocorrelation function of the waveform envelope. 7. Interval distributions in populations of neurons constitute a general, distributed means of encoding, transmitting, and representing information. Existence of a central processor capable of analyzing these interval patterns could provide a unified explanation for many different aspects of pitch perception.},

	abstract = {Bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users perform poorly on tasks involving interaural time differences (ITD), which are critical for sound localization and speech reception in noise by normal-hearing listeners. ITD perception with bilateral CI is influenced by age at onset of deafness and duration of deafness. We previously showed that ITD coding in the auditory midbrain is degraded in congenitally deaf white cats (DWC) compared to acutely deafened cats (ADC) with normal auditory development (Hancock et al., J. Neurosci, 30:14068). To determine the relative importance of early onset of deafness and prolonged duration of deafness for abnormal ITD coding in DWC, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus of cats deafened as adults 6 months prior to experimentation (long-term deafened cats, LTDC) and compared neural ITD coding between the three deafness models. The incidence of ITD-sensitive neurons was similar in both groups with normal auditory development (LTDC and ADC), but significantly diminished in DWC. In contrast, both groups that experienced prolonged deafness (LTDC and DWC) had broad distributions of best ITDs around the midline, unlike the more focused distributions biased toward contralateral-leading ITDs present in both ADC and normal-hearing animals. The lack of contralateral bias in LTDC and DWC results in reduced sensitivity to changes in ITD within the natural range. The finding that early onset of deafness more severely degrades neural ITD coding than prolonged duration of deafness argues for the importance of fitting deaf children with sound processors that provide reliable ITD cues at an early age.},

	abstract = {Modulations in temporal envelopes are a ubiquitous property of natural sounds and are especially important for hearing with cochlear implants (CIs) because these devices typically discard temporal fine structure information. With few exceptions, neural temporal envelope processing has been studied in both normal hearing (NH) and CI animals using only pure sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) which poorly represents the diversity of envelope shapes contained in natural sounds because it confounds repetition rate and the width of each modulation cycle. Here, we used stimuli that allow independent manipulation of the two parameters to characterize envelope processing by inferior colliculus (IC) neurons in barbiturate-anesthetized cats with CIs. Specifically, the stimuli were amplitude modulated, high rate pulse trains, where the envelope waveform interleaved single cycles ("bursts") of a sinusoid with silent intervals. We found that IC neurons vary widely with respect to the envelope parameters that maximize their firing rates. In general, pure SAM was a relatively ineffective stimulus. The majority of neurons (60 \%) preferred a combination of short bursts and low repetition rates (long silent intervals). Others preferred low repetition rates with minimal dependence on envelope width (17 \%), while the remainder responded most strongly to brief bursts with lesser sensitivity to repetition rate (23 \%). A simple phenomenological model suggests that a combination of inhibitory and intrinsic cellular mechanisms suffices to account for the wide variation in optimal envelope shapes. In contrast to the strong dependence of firing rate on envelope shape, neurons tended to phase lock precisely to the envelope regardless of shape. Most neurons tended to fire specifically near the peak of the modulation cycle, with little phase dispersion within or across neurons. Such consistently precise timing degrades envelope coding compared to NH processing of real-world sounds, because it effectively eliminates spike timing as a cue to envelope shape.},

	abstract = {Speech reception depends critically on temporal modulations in the amplitude envelope of the speech signal. Reverberation encountered in everyday environments can substantially attenuate these modulations. To assess the effect of reverberation on the neural coding of amplitude envelope, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbit using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (AM) broadband noise stimuli presented in simulated anechoic and reverberant environments. Although reverberation degraded both rate and temporal coding of AM in IC neurons, in most neurons, the degradation in temporal coding was smaller than the AM attenuation in the stimulus. This compensation could largely be accounted for by the compressive shape of the modulation input-output function (MIOF), which describes the nonlinear transformation of modulation depth from acoustic stimuli into neural responses. Additionally, in a subset of neurons, the temporal coding of AM was better for reverberant stimuli than for anechoic stimuli having the same modulation depth at the ear. Using hybrid anechoic stimuli that selectively possess certain properties of reverberant sounds, we show that this reverberant advantage is not caused by envelope distortion, static interaural decorrelation, or spectral coloration. Overall, our results suggest that the auditory system may possess dual mechanisms that make the coding of amplitude envelope relatively robust in reverberation: one general mechanism operating for all stimuli with small modulation depths, and another mechanism dependent on very specific properties of reverberant stimuli, possibly the periodic fluctuations in interaural correlation at the modulation frequency.},

	abstract = {At lower levels of sensory processing, the representation of a stimulus feature in the response of a neural population can vary in complex ways across different stimulus intensities, potentially changing the amount of feature-relevant information in the response. How higher-level neural circuits could implement feature decoding computations that compensate for these intensity-dependent variations remains unclear. Here we focused on neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbits, whose firing rates are sensitive to both the azimuthal position of a sound source and its sound level. We found that the azimuth tuning curves of an IC neuron at different sound levels tend to be linear transformations of each other. These transformations could either increase or decrease the mutual information between source azimuth and spike count with increasing level for individual neurons, yet population azimuthal information remained constant across the absolute sound levels tested (35, 50, and 65 dB SPL), as inferred from the performance of a maximum-likelihood neural population decoder. We harnessed evidence of level-dependent linear transformations to reduce the number of free parameters in the creation of an accurate cross-level population decoder of azimuth. Interestingly, this decoder predicts monotonic azimuth tuning curves, broadly sensitive to contralateral azimuths, in neurons at higher levels in the auditory pathway.},

	abstract = {Users of cochlear implant (CI) face challenges in everyday situations such as understanding conversations in noise, even with CIs in both ears. These challenges are related to difficulties with tasks that require fine temporal processing such as discrimination of pulse rates or interaural time differences (ITD), a major cue for sound localization. The degradation in temporal processing and ITD sensitivity are especially acute in those who lost hearing in early childhood. Here, we characterized temporal coding and ITD sensitivity of single neurons in a novel animal model of early-onset deafness. Rabbits were deafened as neonates and deprived of auditory stimulation until they reached adult age when single-unit recordings from the auditory midbrain were made chronically using an unanesthetized preparation. The results are compared to measurements from adult-deafened rabbits with normal auditory development to understand the effect of early-onset deafness on neural temporal coding and ITD sensitivity. Neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of early-deafened rabbits were less likely to show sustained, excitatory responses to pulse train stimulation and more likely to show suppressive responses compared to neurons in adult-deaf animals. Fewer neurons showed synchronized responses to pulse trains at any rate in the early-deaf group. In addition, fewer neurons showed significant ITD sensitivity in their overall firing rate in the early-deaf group compared to adult-deaf animals. Neural ITD discrimination thresholds in the early-deaf group were poorer than thresholds in adult-deaf group, especially at high pulse rates. The overall degradation in neural ITD sensitivity is consistent with the difficulties encountered by human CI users with early-onset hearing loss. These results lay the groundwork for investigating whether the degradations in temporal coding and ITD sensitivity observed in early-deaf animals can be reversed by appropriate CI stimulation during development.},

	abstract = {Binaural cues occurring in natural environments are frequently time varying, either from the motion of a sound source or through interactions between the cues produced by multiple sources. Yet, a broad understanding of how the auditory system processes dynamic binaural cues is still lacking. In the current study, we directly compared neural responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbits to broadband noise with time-varying interaural time differences (ITD) with responses to noise with sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) over a wide range of modulation frequencies. On the basis of prior research, we hypothesized that the IC, one of the first stages to exhibit tuning of firing rate to modulation frequency, might use a common mechanism to encode time-varying information in general. Instead, we found weaker temporal coding for dynamic ITD compared with amplitude modulation and stronger effects of adaptation for amplitude modulation. The differences in temporal coding of dynamic ITD compared with SAM at the single-neuron level could be a neural correlate of "binaural sluggishness," the inability to perceive fluctuations in time-varying binaural cues at high modulation frequencies, for which a physiological explanation has so far remained elusive. At ITD-variation frequencies of 64 Hz and above, where a temporal code was less effective, noise with a dynamic ITD could still be distinguished from noise with a constant ITD through differences in average firing rate in many neurons, suggesting a frequency-dependent tradeoff between rate and temporal coding of time-varying binaural information.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Humans use time-varying binaural cues to parse auditory scenes comprising multiple sound sources and reverberation. However, the neural mechanisms for doing so are poorly understood. Our results demonstrate a potential neural correlate for the reduced detectability of fluctuations in time-varying binaural information at high speeds, as occurs in reverberation. The results also suggest that the neural mechanisms for processing time-varying binaural and monaural cues are largely distinct.},

To investigate this organization, we used tetrodes to record from neighboring neurons in the ICC of anesthetized cats and studied the similarity and difference among the responses of these neurons to pure-tone stimuli using widely used physiological characterizations. Consistent with the tonotopic arrangement of neurons in the ICC and reports of a threshold map, we found a high degree of correlation in the best frequencies (BFs) of neighboring neurons, which were mostly {\textless}3 kHz in our sample, and the pure-tone thresholds among neighboring neurons. However, width of frequency tuning, shapes of the frequency response areas, and temporal discharge patterns showed little or no correlation among neighboring neurons. Because the BF and threshold are measured at levels near the threshold and the characteristic frequency (CF), neighboring neurons may receive similar primary inputs tuned to their CF; however, at higher levels, additional inputs from other frequency channels may be recruited, introducing greater variability in the responses. There was also no correlation among neighboring neurons' sensitivity to interaural time differences (ITD) measured with binaural beats. However, the characteristic phases (CPs) of neighboring neurons revealed a significant correlation. Because the CP is related to the neural mechanisms generating the ITD sensitivity, this result is consistent with segregation of inputs to the ICC from the lateral and medial superior olives.},

This is particularly evident when investigating short-latency neural activity in response to high-rate electrical stimulation. We developed and evaluated an off-line technique for the removal of stimulus artifact from electrophysiological recordings. Pulsatile electrical stimulation was presented at rates of up to 5000 pulses/s during extracellular recordings of guinea pig auditory nerve fibers. Stimulus artifact was removed by replacing the sample points at each stimulus artifact event with values interpolated along a straight line, computed from neighbouring sample points. This technique required only that artifact events be identifiable and that the artifact duration remained less than both the inter-stimulus interval and the time course of the action potential. We have demonstrated that this computationally efficient sample-and-interpolate technique removes the stimulus artifact with minimal distortion of the action potential waveform. We suggest that this technique may have potential applications in a range of electrophysiological recording systems.},

The diagnostic value of the ABR depends on knowledge about the anatomical sources of its characteristic waves. Here, we studied the contribution of the inferior colliculus (IC) to the click-evoked scalp ABR in mice. We demonstrate a non-invasive correlate of the IC response that can be measured in the scalp ABR as a slow positive wave P0 with peak latency 7–8 ms when recorded with adequate band-pass filtering. Wave P0 showed close correspondence in latency, magnitude and shape with the sustained part of evoked spiking activity and local field potentials (LFP) in the central nucleus of the IC. In addition, the onset peaks of the IC response were related temporally to ABR wave V and to some extent to wave IV. This relation was further supported by depth-dependent modulation of the shape of ABR wave IV and V within the IC suggesting generation within or in close vicinity to the IC. In conclusion, the slow ABR wave P0 in the scalp ABR may represent a complementary non-invasive marker for IC activity in the mouse. Further, the latency of synchronized click-evoked activity in the IC supports the view that IC contributes to ABR wave V, and possibly also to ABR wave IV.},

Yet, it is difficult to determine from this information whether this potential in the cat would be equivalent to the fifth potential in human brain stem auditory response. In order to facilitate the interpretation of human data from studies on animal models, the authors have investigated the variation of brain stem auditory response among several mammalian species using the lesion method and the method of binaural interactions. Two carnivores (dog and cat) and two rodents (rat and guinea pig) were studied. Emphasis will be on the contribution from inferior colliculus.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) characterize morphological characteristics of the electrically evoked cortical auditory event-related potentials (eERPs) and explore the potential association between onset eERP morphology and auditory versus nonauditory stimulation; (2) assess test-retest reliability of onset eERPs; (3) investigate effects of stimulation level on onset eERPs; and (4) explore the feasibility of using the onset eERP to estimate the lowest stimulation level that can be detected for individual stimulating electrodes in patients with auditory brainstem implants (ABIs). DESIGN: Study participants included 5 children (S1 to S5) and 2 adults (S6 to S7) with unilateral Cochlear Nucleus 24M ABIs. Pediatric ABI recipients ranged in age from 2.6 to 10.2 years (mean: 5.2 years) at the time of testing. S6 and S7 were 21.2 and 24.6 years of age at the time of testing, respectively. S6 and S7 were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis II (NF2) and implanted with an ABI after a surgical removal of the tumors. All pediatric subjects received ABIs after being diagnosed with cochlear nerve deficiency. The lowest stimulation level that could be detected (behavioral T level) and the estimated maximum comfortable level (C level) was measured for individual electrodes using clinical procedures. For electrophysiological measures, the stimulus was a 100-msec biphasic pulse train that was delivered to individual electrodes in a monopolar-coupled stimulation mode at stimulation levels ranging from subthreshold to C levels. Electrophysiological recordings of the onset eERP were obtained in all subjects. For studies evaluating the test-retest reliability of the onset eERP, responses were measured using the same set of parameters in two test sessions. The time interval between test sessions ranged from 2 to 6 months. The lowest stimulation level that could evoke the onset eERP was defined as the objective T level. RESULTS: Onset eERPs were recorded in all subjects tested in this study. Inter- and intrasubject variations in morphological characteristics of onset eERPs were observed. Onset eERPs with complex waveforms were recorded for electrodes that evoked nonauditory sensations, based on feedback from subjects, as well as for electrodes without any indications of nonauditory stimulations. Onset eERPs in patients with ABIs demonstrated good test-retest reliability. Increasing stimulation levels resulted in increased eERP amplitudes but showed inconsistent effects on response latencies in patients with ABIs. Objective and behavioral T levels were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: eERPs could be recorded in both non-NF2 and NF2 patients with ABIs. eERPs in both ABI patient groups show inter- and intrasubject variations in morphological characteristics. However, onset eERPs measured within the same subject in this study tended to be stable across study sessions. The onset eERP can potentially be used to estimate behavioral T levels in patients with ABIs. Further studies with more adult ABI recipients are warranted to investigate whether the onset eERP can be used to identify electrodes with nonauditory stimulations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: Auditory brainstem implants (ABI) use the same processing strategy as was developed for cochlear implants (CI). However, the cochlear nucleus (CN), the stimulation site of ABIs, is anatomically and physiologically more complex than the auditory nerve and consists of neurons with differing roles in auditory processing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypotheses that ABI users are less able than CI users to access speech spectro-temporal information delivered by the existing strategies and that the sites stimulated by different locations of CI and ABI electrode arrays differ in encoding of temporal patterns in the stimulation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDESIGN:: Six CI users and four ABI users of Nucleus implants with ACE processing strategy participated in this study. Closed-set perception of aCa syllables (16 consonants) and bVd words (11 vowels) was evaluated via experimental processing strategies that activated one, two, or four of the electrodes of the array in a CIS manner as well as subjects' clinical strategies. Three single-channel strategies presented the overall temporal envelope variations of the signal on a single-implant electrode located at the high-, medium-, and low-frequency regions of the array. Implantees' ability to discriminate within electrode temporal patterns of stimulation for phoneme perception and their ability to make use of spectral information presented by increased number of active electrodes were assessed in the single- and multiple-channel strategies, respectively. Overall percentages and information transmission of phonetic features were obtained for each experimental program.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS:: Phoneme perception performance of three ABI users was within the range of CI users in most of the experimental strategies and improved as the number of active electrodes increased. One ABI user performed close to chance with all the single and multiple electrode strategies. There was no significant difference between apical, basal, and middle CI electrodes in transmitting speech temporal information, except a trend that the voicing feature was the least transmitted by the basal electrode. A similar electrode-location pattern could be observed in most ABI subjects.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS:: Although the number of tested ABI subjects was small, their wide range of phoneme perception performance was consistent with previous reports of overall speech perception in ABI patients. The better-performing ABI user participants had access to speech temporal and spectral information that was comparable to that of average CI user. The poor-performing ABI user did not have access to within-channel speech temporal information and did not benefit from an increased number of spectral channels. The within-subject variability between different ABI electrodes was less than the variability across users in transmission of speech temporal information. The difference in the performance of ABI users could be related to the location of their electrode array on the CN, anatomy, and physiology of their CN or the damage to their auditory brainstem due to tumor or surgery.},

	abstract = {Damage to the auditory system following high-level sound exposure reduces afferent input. Homeostatic mechanisms appear to compensate for the loss. Overcompensation may produce the sensation of sound without an objective physical correlate, i.e., tinnitus. Several potential compensatory neural processes have been identified, such as increased spontaneous activity. The cellular mechanisms enabling such compensatory processes may involve down-regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), and/or up-regulation of excitatory neurotransmission, mediated by glutamic acid (Glu). Because central processing systems are integrated and well-regulated, compensatory changes in one system may produce reactive changes in others. Some or all may be relevant to tinnitus. To examine the roles of GABA and Glu in tinnitus, high resolution point-resolved proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was used to quantify their levels in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB), and primary auditory cortex (A1) of rats. Chronic tinnitus was produced by a single high-level unilateral exposure to noise, and was measured using a psychophysical procedure sensitive to tinnitus. Decreased GABA levels were evident only in the MGB, with the greatest decrease, relative to unexposed controls, obtained in the contralateral MGB. Small GABA increases may have been present bilaterally in A1 and in the contralateral DCN. Although Glu levels showed considerable variation, Glu was moderately and bilaterally elevated both in the DCN and in A1. In the MGB Glu was increased ipsilaterally but decreased contralaterally. These bidirectional and region-specific alterations in GABA and Glu may reflect large-scale changes in inhibitory and excitatory equilibrium accompanying chronic tinnitus. The present results also suggest that targeting both neurotransmitter systems may be optimal in developing more effective therapeutics.},

Although it contains various types of neurons, the origins of the distinct subtypes and their developmental molecular machinery are still elusive. Here we reveal that two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors play crucial roles in specifying neuron subtypes in the CN. Pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) and atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) were found to be expressed in discrete dorsolateral regions of the embryonic neuroepithelia of the middle hindbrain (rhombomeres 2-5). Genetic lineage tracing using mice that express Cre recombinase from the Ptf1a locus or under the control of the Atoh1 promoter revealed that inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) or excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons of both DCN and VCN are derived from the Ptf1a- and Atoh1-expressing neuroepithelial regions, respectively. In the Ptf1a or Atoh1 null embryos, production of inhibitory or excitatory neurons, respectively, was severely inhibited in the CN. These findings suggest that inhibitory and excitatory subtypes of CN neurons are defined by Ptf1a and Atoh1, respectively and, furthermore, provide important insights into understanding the machinery of neuron subtype specification in the dorsal hindbrain.},

HRP-labeled terminals were found in the cochlear nuclei as well as in periolivary cell groups.

Labeled cells were abundant in the dorsal and posteroventral cochlear nucleus adjacent to the injection as well as scattered throughout the periolivary cell groups of both sides, being highest in concentration around the ipsilateral lateral superior olive. On the side contralateral to the injection, labeled cells were found along the medial border of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, in the interstitial nucleus of the stria of Held, and sparsely throughout the ventral cochlear nucleus. The distribution of labeled cells was similar following HRP injections of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, except that these injections revealed additional descending projections from the inferior colliculi and from the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body of both sides. These additional projections were interpreted as entering the CN by a ventral route. Findings of this study are in accord with physiological recordings made from fibers of the acoustic striae.},

	abstract = {An attempt was made to correlate electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of rat ventral cochlear nucleus neurons. Their axonal course and their soma morphology were investigated using the intra-axonal horseradish peroxidase method. Prior to labeling, neurons were characterized by recording their response patterns to acoustic stimulation with pure tones. Three types of cells were found: Category I (37 neurons) exhibited "primarylike" responses and a spontaneous firing rate below 10 spikes/s. Category II (21 neurons) showed "on" responses and little spontaneous activity. Category III (9 neurons) had "primarylike" responses like neurons in category I. However, the spontaneous activity rate of these neurons was significantly higher (mean: 95 spikes/s). Among the response categories, the morphological characteristics differed in some prominent aspects. Within each category, however, the morphological properties were rather similar. All neurons in category I were globular/bushy cells located in the area of the entrance of the cochlear nerve. The axon of each cell coursed along the ventral acoustic stria and consistently innervated the lateral superior olive ipsilaterally, and the nucleus of the trapezoid body and the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus contralaterally. Some neurons also projected to periolivary nuclei ipsilaterally and contralaterally. Neurons in category II were located in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus and were presumably multipolar/stellate cells. Their axons coursed via the intermediate acoustic stria and innervated mainly contralateral periolivary regions as well as the contralateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. Ipsilaterally, the lateral superior olive and the superior periolivary nucleus were innervated by some of the category II neurons. Somata types of neurons in category III could not be identified morphologically, but somata were located in caudal parts of the posteroventral cochlear nucleus that correspond to the octopus cell area. Their axons coursed via the intermediate acoustic stria and innervated periolivary regions and the contralateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. Thus, their axonal distribution differed only slightly from neurons in category II. These data confirm and extend previous findings regarding the efferent connections of ventral cochlear neurons. They emphasize the complexity of the axonal projection patterns of single cochlear nucleus cells. Since two types of response patterns and three types of axonal projection patterns have been observed, there remains an ambiguous relation between response pattern and axonal projection site.},

Arrays of silicon probes with 16 stimulating sites were implanted into the VCN of adult cats, for up to 314 days. Compound neuronal responses evoked from the sites in the VCN were recorded periodically in the central nucleus of the contralateral inferior colliculus (ICC). The threshold and growth of most of the responses were stable for at least 250 days after implantation of the arrays. The responses evoked from the deepest and shallowest electrode sites did exhibit some changes over time but none of the thresholds exceeded 10 microA. The thresholds and growth of the compound responses from most of the stimulating sites were very stable over time, and comparable to those of chronically implanted single-site iridium microelectrodes. Multiunit neuronal activity evoked from the stimulating sites in the VCN was recorded along the dorsolateral-ventromedial (DLVM) axis of the ICC. The distribution, span and degree of overlap of the multiunit activity demonstrated the utility of the multisite, multishank array configuration as a means of accessing the neuronal populations in the VCN that encode various acoustic frequencies. These findings are encouraging for the prospects of developing an auditory prosthesis employing multi-site silicon microprobes.},

We investigated the relation between speech understanding and neural envelope tracking in CI users. EEG was recorded in 8 CI users while they listened to a story. Speech understanding was varied by changing the intensity of the presented speech. The speech envelope was reconstructed from the EEG using a linear decoder. Next, the reconstructed envelope was correlated with the envelope of the speech stimulus as a measure of neural envelope tracking which was compared to actual speech understanding. This study showed that neural envelope tracking increased with increasing speech understanding in every participant. Furthermore behaviorally measured speech understanding was correlated with participant-specific neural envelope tracking results indicating the potential of neural envelope tracking as an objective measure of speech understanding in CI users. This could enable objective and automatic fitting of CIs and pave the way towards closed-loop CIs that adjust continuously and automatically to individual CI users.},

A partial solution to these problems is to preoperatively evaluate the functional integrity of the auditory neural pathways. For evaluating the strength of phase-locking of auditory neurons, which was not reflected in previous methods using electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR), a new method for recording phase-locking related auditory responses to electrical stimulation, called the electrically evoked frequency-following response (EFFR), was developed and evaluated using guinea pigs. The main objective was to assess feasibility of the method by testing whether the recorded signals reflected auditory neural responses or artifacts. The results showed the following: 1) the recorded signals were evoked by neuron responses rather than by artifact; 2) responses evoked by periodic signals were significantly higher than those evoked by the white noise; 3) the latency of the responses fell in the expected range; 4) the responses decreased significantly after death of the guinea pigs; and 5) the responses decreased significantly when the animal was replaced by an electrical resistance. All of these results suggest the method was valid. Recording obtained using complex tones with a missing fundamental component and using pure tones with various frequencies were consistent with those obtained using acoustic stimulation in previous studies.},

	abstract = {MRI templates and digital atlases are needed for automated and reproducible quantitative analysis of non-human primate PET studies. Segmenting brain images via multiple atlases outperforms single-atlas labelling in humans. We present a set of atlases manually delineated on brain MRI scans of the monkey Macaca fascicularis. We use this multi-atlas dataset to evaluate two automated methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and reliability in segmenting brain structures on MRI and extracting regional PET measures. Methods: Twelve individual Macaca fascicularis high-resolution 3DT1 MR images were acquired. Four individual atlases were created by manually drawing 42 anatomical structures, including cortical and sub-cortical structures, white matter regions, and ventricles. To create the MRI template, we first chose one MRI to define a reference space, and then performed a two-step iterative procedure: affine registration of individual MRIs to the reference MRI, followed by averaging of the twelve resampled MRIs. Automated segmentation in native space was obtained in two ways: 1) Maximum probability atlases were created by decision fusion of two to four individual atlases in the reference space, and transformation back into the individual native space (MAXPROB). 2) One to four individual atlases were registered directly to the individual native space, and combined by decision fusion (PROPAG). Accuracy was evaluated by computing the Dice similarity index and the volume difference. The robustness and reproducibility of PET regional measurements obtained via automated segmentation was evaluated on four co-registered MRI/PET datasets, which included test-retest data. Results: Dice indices were always over 0.7 and reached maximal values of 0.9 for PROPAG with all four individual atlases. There was no significant mean volume bias. The standard deviation of the bias decreased significantly when increasing the number of individual atlases. MAXPROB performed better when increasing the number of atlases used. When all four atlases were used for the MAXPROB creation, the accuracy of morphometric segmentation approached that of the PROPAG method. PET measures extracted either via automatic methods or via the manually defined regions were strongly correlated, with no significant regional differences between methods. Intra-class correlation coefficients for test-retest data were over 0.87. Conclusions: Compared to single atlas extractions, multi-atlas methods improve the accuracy of region definition. They also perform comparably to manually defined regions for PET quantification. Multiple atlases of Macaca fascicularis brains are now available and allow reproducible and simplified analyses. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Technologies for silencing the electrical activity of genetically targeted neurons in the brain are important for assessing the contribution of specific cell types and pathways toward behaviors and pathologies. Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (∼900 pA in vitro), but with a {\textgreater}3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1-10 mW/mm(2), equating to {\textgreater}2× increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (∼100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {Optogenetics has proven to be a revolutionary technology in neuroscience and has advanced continuously over the past decade. However, optical stimulation technologies for in vivo need to be developed to match the advances in genetics and biochemistry that have driven this field. In particular, conventional approaches for in vivo optical illumination have a limitation on the achievable spatio-temporal resolution. Here we utilize a sapphire-based microscale gallium nitride light-emitting diode (μLED) probe to activate neocortical neurons in vivo. The probes were designed to contain independently controllable multiple μLEDs, emitting at 450 nm wavelength with an irradiance of up to 2 W/mm(2). Monte-Carlo stimulations predicted that optical stimulation using a μLED can modulate neural activity within a localized region. To validate this prediction, we tested this probe in the mouse neocortex that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and compared the results with optical stimulation through a fiber at the cortical surface. We confirmed that both approaches reliably induced action potentials in cortical neurons and that the μLED probe evoked strong responses in deep neurons. Due to the possibility to integrate many optical stimulation sites onto a single shank, the μLED probe is thus a promising approach to control neurons locally in vivo.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation is a remarkable therapy that has mainstreamed electrical stimulation of the brain for the treatment of neurological dysfunction. To appreciate the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation, we need to understand the excitability of neural tissue. Here, we survey the pertinent principles of electrical excitation in the brain. The amount of current delivered and the tissue conductivity together determine the strength and extent of potentials generated by stimulation. The electrode-tissue interface is an important junction where electrical charge carriers in the stimulation hardware are converted to ionic charge carriers in the tissue. Cathodic stimulation tends to depolarize neural elements more easily than anodic stimulation. The current-distance relationship describes how the amount of current needed to excite an axon increases as a function of its distance from the electrode. This relationship also depends on the axon's diameter because large-diameter axons are excited more easily than small-diameter axons. For a given axon, the strength-duration relationship describes the inverse relationship between threshold current amplitude and pulse duration. Specific stimulation parameters must be considered to avoid stimulation-induced tissue damage. A strong foundation in these principles facilitates understanding of the complex effects of electrical stimulation in the brain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from germline mutations in the NF2 gene. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas, tumors on cranial nerve VIII, are pathognomonic for NF2 disease. Furthermore, schwannomas also commonly develop in other cranial nerves, dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. These tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and medical therapies to treat them are limited. Animal models that accurately recapitulate the full anatomical spectrum of human NF2-related schwannomas, including the characteristic functional deficits in hearing and balance associated with cranial nerve VIII tumors, would allow systematic evaluation of experimental therapeutics prior to clinical use. Here, we present a genetically engineered NF2 mouse model generated through excision of the Nf2 gene driven by Cre expression under control of a tissue-restricted 3.9kbPeriostin promoter element. By 10 months of age, 100\% of Postn-Cre; Nf2flox/flox mice develop spinal, peripheral and cranial nerve tumors histologically identical to human schwannomas. In addition, the development of cranial nerve VIII tumors correlates with functional impairments in hearing and balance, as measured by auditory brainstem response and vestibular testing. Overall, the Postn-Cre; Nf2flox/flox tumor model provides a novel tool for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of NF2-associated schwannomas.},

Specifically, the application of micro-magnetic fields to the dorsal cochlear nucleus activates inferior colliculus neurons.

Despite their remarkable success, there are limitations which if overcome, could enhance outcomes and potentially reduce common side-effects. Micromagnetic stimulation (uMS) was introduced to address some of these limitations. One of the most remarkable properties is that uMS is theoretically capable of activating neurons with specific axonal orientations. Here we used computational electromagnetic models of the uMS coils adjacent to neuronal tissue combined with axon cable models to investigate uMS orientation-specific properties. We found a twenty-fold reduction in the stimulation threshold of the preferred axonal orientation compared to the orthogonal direction. We also studied the directional specificity of uMS coils by recording the responses evoked in the inferior colliculus of rodents when a pulsed magnetic stimulus was applied to the surface of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The results confirmed that the neuronal responses were highly sensitive to changes in the uMS coil orientation. Accordingly, our results suggest that uMS has the potential of stimulating target nuclei in the brain without affecting the surrounding white matter tracts.},

To better understand how this variability is related to central processing differences, the current electroencephalography (EEG) study compared hearing abilities and auditory–cortex activation in patients with electrical stimulation at different sites of the auditory pathway. Three different groups of patients with auditory implants (Hannover Medical School; ABI: n = 6, CI: n = 6; AMI: n = 2) performed a speeded response task and a speech recognition test with auditory, visual, and audio–visual stimuli. Behavioral performance and cortical processing of auditory and audio–visual stimuli were compared between groups. ABI and AMI patients showed prolonged response times on auditory and audio–visual stimuli compared with NH listeners and CI patients. This was confirmed by prolonged N1 latencies and reduced N1 amplitudes in ABI and AMI patients. However, patients with central auditory implants showed a remarkable gain in performance when visual and auditory input was combined, in both speech and non-speech conditions, which was reflected by a strong visual modulation of auditory–cortex activation in these individuals. In sum, the results suggest that the behavioral improvement for audio–visual conditions in central auditory implant patients is based on enhanced audio–visual interactions in the auditory cortex. Their findings may provide important implications for the optimization of electrical stimulation and rehabilitation strategies in patients with central auditory prostheses.},

	abstract = {The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a sound-evoked neural response commonly used to assess auditory function in humans and laboratory animals. ABR thresholds are typically chosen by visual inspection, leaving the procedure susceptible to user bias. We sought to develop an algorithm to automate determination of ABR thresholds to eliminate such biases and to standardize approaches across investigators and laboratories. Two datasets of mouse ABR waveforms obtained from previously published studies of normal ears as well as ears with varying degrees of cochlear-based threshold elevations (Maison et al., 2013; Sergeyenko et al., 2013) were reanalyzed using an algorithm based on normalized cross-covariation of adjacent level presentations. Correlation-coefficient vs. level data for each ABR level series were fit with both a sigmoidal and two-term power function. From these fits, threshold was interpolated at different criterion values of correlation-coefficient ranging from 0 to 0.5. The criterion value of 0.35 was selected by comparing visual thresholds to computed thresholds across all frequencies tested. With such a criterion, the mean algorithm-computed thresholds were comparable to the visual thresholds noted by two independent observers for each data set. The success of the algorithm was also qualitatively assessed by comparing averaged waveforms at the thresholds determined by the two methods, and quantitatively assessed by comparing peak 1 amplitude growth functions expressed as dB re each of the two threshold measures. Application of a cross-covariance analysis to ABR waveforms can emulate visual thresholding decisions made by highly trained observers. Unlike previous applications of similar methodologies using template matching, our algorithm performs only intrinsic comparisons within ABR sets, and therefore is more robust to equipment and investigator differences in assessing waveforms, as evidenced by similar results across the two datasets.},

Such implants are skull-mounted, and made from a hard, durable material, such as titanium. New method Here, we present a low-cost method of creating customized 3D-printed cranial implants that are tailored to the anatomy of individual animals. We performed pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scans to generate three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and brain. We then used 3D modelling software to design implantable head posts, chambers, and a pedestal anchorage base, as well as craniotomy guides to aid us during surgery. Prototypes were made from plastic or resin, while implants were 3D-printed in titanium. The implants underwent post-processing and received a coating of osteocompatible material to promote bone integration. Results Their tailored fit greatly facilitated surgical implantation, and eliminated the gap between the implant and the bone. To date, our implants remain robust and well-integrated with the skull. Comparison with existing method(s) Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions typically come with a uniform, flat base, preventing them from sitting flush against the curved surface of the skull. This leaves gaps for fluid and tissue ingress, increasing the risk of microbial infection and tissue inflammation, as well as implant loss.

Desktop 3D printers can now produce relatively inexpensive, good quality prints. We describe our process for reliably generating life-sized 3D brain prints from MRIs and 3D skull prints from CTs. We have integrated a standardized, primarily open-source process for 3D printing brains and skulls. We describe how to convert clinical neuroimaging Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images to stereolithography (STL) files, a common 3D object file format that can be sent to 3D printing services.We additionally share how to convert these STL files to machine instruction gcode files, for reliable in-house printing on desktop, open-source 3D printers. We have successfully printed over 19 patient brain hemispheres from 7 patients on two different open-source desktop 3D printers. Each brain hemisphere costs approximately \$3-4 in consumable plastic filament as described, and the total process takes 14-17 hours, almost all of which is unsupervised (preprocessing=4-6 hr; printing=9-11 hr, post-processing={\textless}30 min). Printing a matching portion of a skull costs \$1-5 in consumable plastic filament and takes less than 14 hr, in total. We have developed a streamlined, cost-effective process for 3D printing brain and skull models.

The cable may be excited by an intracellular source or by an arbitrary, time-varying, applied extracellular field. When the cable is stimulated by a distant source, its properties are qualitatively similar to an unmyelinated fiber. Under these conditions relative threshold is proportional to the cube of the source distance and inversely proportional to the square of the fiber diameter. Electrical parameters of the model are chosen where possible, from mammalian peripheral nerve and anatomic parameters from cat auditory nerve. Several anatomic representations of the paranodal region are analyzed for their effects on the length and time constants of the fibers. Sensitivity of the model to parameter changes is studied. The linear model reliably predicts the effects of fiber size and electrode-fiber separation on threshold of cat dorsal column fibers to extracellular electrical stimulation. © 1991, The Biophysical Society.

	abstract = {The cable model of a passive, unmyelinated fiber in an applied extracellular field is derived. The solution is valid for an arbitrary, time-varying, applied field, which may be determined analytically or numerically. Simple analytical computations are presented. They explain a variety of known phenomena and predict some previously undescribed properties of extracellular electrical stimulation. The polarization of a fiber in an applied field behaves like the output of a spatial high-pass and temporal low-pass filter of the stimulus. High-frequency stimulation results in a more spatially restricted region of fiber excitation, effectively reducing current spread relative to that produced by low-frequency stimulation. Chronaxie measured extracellularly is a function of electrode position relative to the stimulated fiber, and its value may differ substantially from that obtained intracellularly. Frequency dependence of psychophysical threshold obtained by electrical stimulation of the macaque cochlea closely follows the frequency dependence of single-fiber passive response. © 1988, The Biophysical Society.

Small animal connectivity mapping techniques are particularly important for identifying aberrant connectivity in disease models. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography can provide nondestructive, 3D, brain-wide connectivity maps, but has historically been limited by low spatial resolution, low signal-to-noise ratio, and the difficulty in estimating multiple fiber orientations within a single image voxel. Small animal diffusion tractography can be substantially improved through the combination of ex vivo MRI with exogenous contrast agents, advanced diffusion acquisition and reconstruction techniques, and probabilistic fiber tracking. Here, we present a comprehensive, probabilistic tractography connectome of the mouse brain at microscopic resolution, and a comparison of these data with a neuronal tracer-based connectivity data from the Allen Brain Atlas.

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical therapy for medically refractory tremor disorders including essential tremor (ET) and is currently under investigation for use in a variety of other neurologic and psychiatric disorders. There is growing evidence that the anti-tremor effects of DBS for ET are directly related to modulation of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRT), a white matter pathway that connects the cerebellum, red nucleus, and ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus. Emerging white matter targets for DBS, like the DRT, will require improved 3D reference maps of deep brain anatomy and structural connectivity for accurate electrode targeting. High-resolution diffusion MRI of postmortem brain specimens can provide detailed volumetric images of important deep brain nuclei and 3D reconstructions of white matter pathways with probabilistic tractography techniques. We present a high spatial and angular resolution diffusion MRI template of the postmortem human brainstem and thalamus with 3D reconstructions of the nuclei and white matter tracts involved in ET circuitry.

	abstract = {Objective: Electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABR) guide placement of the multichannel auditory brainstem implant (ABI) array during surgery. EABRs are also recorded under anesthesia in nontumor pediatric ABI recipients prior to device activation to confirm placement and guide device programming. We examine the influence of anesthesia on evoked response morphology in pediatric ABI users by comparing intraoperative with postoperative EABR recordings. Study Design: Retrospective review. Methods: Seven children underwent ABI surgery by way of retrosigmoid craniotomy. General anesthesia included inhaled sevoflurane induction and propofol maintenance during which EABRs were recorded to confirm accurate positioning of the ABI. A mean of 7.7 ± 2.8 weeks following surgery, the ABI was activated under general anesthesia or sedation (dexmedetomidine) and EABR recordings were made. A qualitative analysis of intraoperative and postoperative waveform morphology was performed. Results: Seven subjects (mean age 20.6 months) underwent nine ABI surgeries (seven primary, two revisions) and nine activations. EABRs were observed in eight of nine postoperative recordings. In three cases, intraoperative EABRs during general anesthesia were similar to postoperative EABRs with sedation. In one case, sevoflurane and propofol were used for intra- and postoperative recordings, and waveforms were also similar. In four cases, amplitude and latency changes were observed for intraoperative versus postoperative EABRs. Conclusion: Similarity of EABR morphology in the anesthetized versus sedated condition suggests that anesthesia does not have a large effect on far-field evoked potentials. Changes in EABR waveform morphology observed postoperatively may be influenced by other factors such as movements of the surface array. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 2019.},

	abstract = {Hybrid or electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) cochlear implants (CIs) are designed to provide high-frequency electric hearing together with residual low-frequency acoustic hearing. However, 30-50\% of EAS CI recipients lose residual hearing after implantation. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of EAS-induced hearing loss in an animal model with high-frequency hearing loss. Guinea pigs were exposed to 24h of noise (12-24kHz at 116dB) to induce a high-frequency hearing loss. After recovery, two groups of animals were implanted (n=6 per group), with one group receiving chronic acoustic and electric stimulation for 10 weeks, and the other group receiving no stimulation during this time frame. A third group (n=6) was not implanted, but received chronic acoustic stimulation. Auditory brainstem responses were recorded biweekly to monitor changes in hearing. The organ of Corti was immunolabeled with phalloidin, anti-CtBP2, and anti-GluR2 to quantify hair cells, ribbons and post-synaptic receptors. The lateral wall was immunolabeled with phalloidin and lectin to quantify stria vascularis capillary diameters. Bimodal or trimodal diameter distributions were observed; the number and location of peaks were objectively determined using the Aikake Information Criterion and Expectation Maximization algorithm.Noise exposure led to immediate hearing loss at 16-32kHz for all groups. Cochlear implantation led to additional hearing loss at 4-8kHz; this hearing loss was negatively and positively correlated with minimum and maximum peaks of the bimodal or trimodal distributions of stria vascularis capillary diameters, respectively. After chronic stimulation, no significant group changes in thresholds were seen; however, elevated thresholds at 1kHz in implanted, stimulated animals were significantly correlated with decreased presynaptic ribbon and postsynaptic receptor counts. Inner and outer hair cell counts did not differ between groups and were not correlated with threshold shifts at any frequency.As in the previous study in a normal-hearing model, stria vascularis capillary changes were associated with immediate hearing loss after implantation, while little to no hair cell loss was observed even in cochlear regions with threshold shifts as large as 40-50dB. These findings again support a role of lateral wall blood flow changes, rather than hair cell loss, in hearing loss after surgical trauma, and implicate the endocochlear potential as a factor in implantation-induced hearing loss. Further, the analysis of the hair cell ribbons and post-synaptic receptors suggest that delayed hearing loss may be linked to synapse or peripheral nerve loss due to stimulation excitotoxicity or inflammation. Further research is needed to separate these potential mechanisms of delayed hearing loss.},

	abstract = {Unconsciousness is a fundamental component of general anesthesia (GA), but anesthesiologists have no reliable ways to be certain that a patient is unconscious. To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded highdensity EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power ({\textless}1Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into themechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.},

Compared to areas on the surface of the brain, the anatomical and physiological properties of areas within the fissure are poorly understood. Typically, access to these areas is indirectly achieved by ablating or passing through intervening areas. To enable direct experimental access, a neurosurgical technique was developed in primates whereby the banks of the lateral fissure were retracted with sparing of the vascular network and intervening areas. In some animals, anatomical tracers were directly injected into target fields without contamination of other areas. In others, multichannel electrode arrays were implanted into target areas for chronic recording of neural activity. Since, these techniques could be adapted for exploration of areas within other sulci, the approach represents an important advance in efforts to elucidate the functional organization of the primate cerebral cortex. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to a conventional intrascalar cochlear implant, intraneural stimulation provides access to fibers serving a broader frequency range, activation of more tonotopically restricted fiber populations, lower thresholds, and reduced interference between simultaneously stimulated channels. The spread of excitation by a single intraneural electrode is broader than that by an acoustic tone but narrower than that by a cochlear-implant electrode. In the present study, we compare in an animal model two sites of intraneural stimulation: the modiolar trunk of the nerve accessed using a transcochlear approach and the intracranial portion of the nerve accessed using a posterior fossa approach. The two stimulation sites offer very similar thresholds, spread of activation, and dynamic ranges. The intracranial site differed in that there was greater between-animal variation in tonotopic patterns.

	abstract = {Electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve with a penetrating intraneural (IN) electrode in acutely deafened cats produces much more restricted spread of excitation than is obtained in that preparation with a conventional cochlear implant (CI) as reported by Middlebrooks and Snyder (J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 8:258–279, 2007). That suggests that a future auditory prosthesis employing IN stimulation might offer human patients greater frequency selectivity than is available with a present-day CI. Nevertheless, it is a concern that the electrical field produced by an IN electrode might be too restricted to produce adequate stimulation of the partially depopulated auditory nerve of a deaf patient. We evaluated this by testing responses to IN and CI stimulation in adult-deafened cats. Activation of the auditory pathway was monitored by recording from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). Cats deaf for 153–277 days exhibited a {\textasciitilde} 30 \% loss of auditory nerve fibers compared to cats deaf for {\textless} 18 h. Contrary to our concern, measures of thresholds and dynamic ranges showed no significant deafness-related impairment of excitation by IN or CN stimulation. Surprisingly, however, temporal acuity decreased dramatically in these adult-deafened cats, as demonstrated by a marked decrease in the maximum rate of electrical cochlear stimulation to which ICC neurons synchronized to IN or CI stimulation. For instance, half of ICC neurons synchronized to IN stimulation up to 203 pulses per second (pps) in acute deafness, whereas that number dropped to 79 pps for chronic deafness. Such a loss of temporal acuity might contribute to the poor sensitivity to temporal fine structure that has been reported in human CI users. Seemingly, the degraded temporal acuity that we observed in cats was even worse than the fine-structure sensitivity of human CI users, suggesting that most patients experience some improvement of temporal acuity resulting from restoration of patterned auditory nerve stimulation by a CI.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant speech processors transmit temporal features of sound as amplitude modulation of constant-rate electrical pulse trains. This study evaluated the central representation of amplitude modulation in the form of phase-locked firing of neurons in the auditory cortex. Anesthetized pigmented guinea pigs were implanted with cochlear electrode arrays. Stimuli were 254 pulse/s (pps) trains of biphasic electrical pulses, sinusoidally modulated with frequencies of 10-64 Hz and modulation depths of -40 to -5 dB re 100\% (i.e., 1-56.2\% modulation). Single- and multiunit activity was recorded from multisite silicon-substrate probes. The maximum frequency for significant phase locking (limiting modulation frequency) was ≥60 Hz for 42\% of recording sites, whereas phase locking to pulses of unmodulated pulse trains rarely exceeded 30 pps. The strength of phase locking to frequencies ≥40 Hz often varied nonmonotonically with modulation depth, commonly peaking at modulation depths around -15 to -10 dB. Cortical phase locking coded modulation frequency reliably, whereas a putative rate code for frequency was confounded by rate changes with modulation depth. Group delay computed from the slope of mean phase versus modulation frequency tended to increase with decreasing limiting modulation frequency. Neurons in cortical extragranular layers had lower limiting modulation frequencies than did neurons in thalamic afferent layers. Those observations suggest that the low-pass characteristic of cortical phase locking results from intracortical filtering mechanisms. The results show that cortical neurons can phase lock to modulated electrical pulse trains across the range of modulation frequencies and depths presented by cochlear implant speech processors.

	abstract = {AMPA receptors mediate rapid glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In the mammalian cochlear nuclei, neurons receive excitatory input from either auditory nerve fibers, parallel fibers, or both fiber systems. The functional correlates of differences in the source of input were examined by recording AMPA receptor-mediated, miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode from identified neurons. Bushy, octopus, and T-stellate cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and tuberculoventral cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receive most of their excitatory input from the auditory nerve; fusiform cells receive excitatory inputs from both the auditory nerve and parallel fibers; cartwheel cells receive excitatory input from parallel fibers alone, mEPSCs from bushy, octopus, T-stellate, and tuberculoventral cells had significantly faster decay time constants (0.35- 0.40 msec) than did those from fusiform and cartwheel cells (1.32-1.79 msec). Some fusiform cells had two populations of mEPSCs with distinct time courses. mEPSCs in cells with auditory nerve input alone were inhibited by philanthotoxin, a blocker of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, whereas mEPSCs in cells with parallel fiber input were not. Thus AMPA receptors postsynaptic to the auditory nerve differ from those postsynaptic to parallel fibers both in channel-gating kinetics and in their permeability to calcium. These results confirm the conclusion that synaptic AMPA receptors are specialized according to the source of input (Hunter et al., 1993; Rubio and Wenthold, 1997; Wang et al., 1998).},

Non-penetrating surface grids used in electrocorticography (ECoG) permit simultaneous recording of multiple cortical sites, with limited spatial resolution, due to distance to neuronal tissue, large contact size and high impedances. Here we compared new thin-film parylene C ECoG grids, covering the Guinea pig primary auditory cortex, with simultaneous recordings from penetrating electrode array (PEAs), inserted through openings in the grid material. ECoG grid local field potentials (LFP) showed higher response thresholds and amplitudes compared to PEAs. They enabled, however, fast and reliable tonotopic mapping of the auditory cortex (place-frequency slope: 0.7 mm/octave), with tuning widths similar to PEAs. The ECoG signal correlated best with supragranular layers, exponentially decreasing with cortical depth. The grids also enabled recording of multi-unit activity (MUA), yielding several advantages over LFP recordings, including sharper frequency tunings. ECoG first spike latency showed highest similarity to superficial PEA contacts and MUA traces maximally correlated with PEA recordings from the granular layer. These results confirm high quality of the ECoG grid recordings and the possibility to collect LFP and MUA simultaneously.},

We compared μECoG measurements in auditory cortex using a custom “active” electrode array to those recorded using a conventional “passive” μECoG array. Both of these array responses were also compared with data recorded via intrinsic optical imaging, which is a standard methodology for recording sound-evoked cortical activity. Custom active μECoG arrays generated more veridical representations of the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex than current commercially available passive μECoG arrays. Furthermore, the cortical representation could be measured efficiently with the active arrays, requiring as little as 13.5 s of neural data acquisition. Next, we generated spectrotemporal receptive fields from the recorded neural activity on the active μECoG array and identified functional organizational principles comparable to those observed using intrinsic metabolic imaging and single-neuron recordings.

Similar limits have been observed in neural responses to electric stimulation in animals with CI; however, the upper limit of temporal coding of electric pulse train stimuli in the inferior colliculus (IC) of anesthetized animals is lower than the perceptual limit. We hypothesize that the upper limit of temporal neural coding has been underestimated in previous studies due to the confound of anesthesia. To test this hypothesis, we developed a chronic, awake rabbit preparation for single-unit studies of IC neurons with electric stimulation through CI. Stimuli were periodic trains of biphasic pulses with rates varying from 20 to 1280 pulses per second. We found that IC neurons in awake rabbits showed higher spontaneous activity and greater sustained responses, both excitatory and suppressive, at high pulse rates. Maximum pulse rates that elicited synchronized responses were approximately two times higher in awake rabbits than in earlier studies with anesthetized animals. Here, we demonstrate directly that anesthesia is a major factor underlying these differences by monitoring the responses of single units in one rabbit before and after injection of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate. In general, the physiological rate limits of IC neurons in the awake rabbit are more consistent with the psychophysical limits in human CI subjects compared with limits from anesthetized animals. © 2014 the authors.},

	abstract = {We used the binaural beat stimulus to study the interaural phase sensitivity of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons in the cat. The binaural beat, produced by delivering tones of slightly different frequencies to the two ears, generates continuous and graded changes in the interaural phase. Over 90\% of the cells that exhibit a sensitivity to changes in the interaural delay also show a sensitivity to interaural phase disparities with the binaural beat. Cells respond with a burst of impulses with each complete cycle of the beat frequency. The period histogram obtained by binning the poststimulus time histogram on the beat frequency gives a measure of the interaural phase sensitivity of the cell. In general, there is good correspondence in the shapes of the period histograms generated from binaural beats and the interaural phase curves derived from interaural delays and in the mean interaural phase angle calculated from them. The magnitude of the beat frequency determines the rate of change of interaural phase and the sign determines the direction of phase change. While most cells respond in a phase-locked manner up to beat frequencies of 10 Hz, there are some cells that will phase lock up to 80 Hz. Beat frequency and mean interaural phase angle are linearly related for most cells. Most cells respond equally in the two directions of phase change and with different rates of change, at least up to 10 Hz. However, some IC cells exhibit marked sensitivity to the speed of phase change, either responding more vigorously at low beat frequencies or at high beat frequencies. In addition, other cells demonstrate a clear directional sensitivity. The cells that show sensitivity to the direction and speed of phase changes would be expected to demonstrate a sensitivity to moving sound sources in the free field. Changes in the mean interaural phase of the binaural beat period histograms are used to determine the effects of changes in average and interaural intensity on the phase sensitivity of the cells. The effects of both forms of intensity variation are continuously distributed. The binaural beat offers a number of advantages for studying the interaural phase sensitivity of binaural cells. The dynamic characteristics of the interaural phase can be varied so that the speed and direction of phase change are under direct control. The data can be obtained in a much more efficient manner, as the binaural beat is about 10 times faster in terms of data collection than the interaural delay.},

This is especially true for high-rate ({\textgreater} 300 pps) periodic pulse trains, which are used as carriers in CI processors. Here, we investigate a novel stimulation strategy in which extra pulses are added to high-rate periodic pulse trains to introduce short inter-pulse intervals (SIPIs). We hypothesized that SIPIs can improve neural ITD sensitivity similarly to the effect observed by randomly jittering IPIs (Hancock et al., J. Neurophysiol. 108:714–28, 2012). To test this hypothesis, we measured ITD sensitivity of single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbits with bilateral CIs. Introducing SIPIs into high-rate pulse trains significantly increased firing rates for {\textasciitilde} 60 \% of IC neurons, and the extra spikes tended to be synchronized to the SIPIs. The additional firings produced by SIPIs uncovered latent ITD sensitivity that was comparable to that observed with low-rate pulse trains. In some neurons, high spontaneous firing rates masked the ITD sensitivity introduced by SIPIs. ITD sensitivity in these neurons could be revealed by emphasizing stimulus-synchronized spikes with a coincidence detection analysis. Overall, these results with SIPIs are consistent with the effects observed previously with jittered pulse trains, with the added benefit of retaining control over the timing and number of SIPIs. A novel CI processing strategy could incorporate SIPIs by inserting them at selected times to high-rate pulse train carriers. Such a strategy could potentially improve ITD perception without degrading speech intelligibility and thereby improve outcomes for bilateral CI users.},

	abstract = {Harmonic complex tones (HCTs) found in speech, music, and animal vocalizations evoke strong pitch percepts at their fundamental frequencies. The strongest pitches are produced by HCTs that contain harmonics resolved by cochlear frequency analysis, but HCTs containing solely unresolved harmonics also evoke a weaker pitch at their envelope repetition rate (ERR). In the auditory periphery, neurons phase lock to the stimulus envelope, but this temporal representation of ERR degrades and gives way to rate codes along the ascending auditory pathway. To assess the role of the inferior colliculus (IC) in such transformations, we recorded IC neuron responses to HCT and sinusoidally modulated broadband noise (SAMN) with varying ERR from unanesthetized rabbits. Different interharmonic phase relationships of HCT were used to manipulate the temporal envelope without changing the power spectrum. Many IC neurons demonstrated band-pass rate tuning to ERR between 60 and 1,600 Hz for HCT and between 40 and 500 Hz for SAMN. The tuning was not related to the pure-tone best frequency of neurons but was dependent on the shape of the stimulus envelope, indicating a temporal rather than spectral origin. A phenomenological model suggests that the tuning may arise from peripheral temporal response patterns via synaptic inhibition. We also characterized temporal coding to ERR. Some IC neurons could phase lock to the stimulus envelope up to 900 Hz for either HCT or SAMN, but phase locking was weaker with SAMN. Together, the rate code and the temporal code represent a wide range of ERR, providing strong cues for the pitch of unresolved harmonics.},

	abstract = {Objective. Optogenetics provides a means to probe functional connections between brain areas. By activating a set of presynaptic neurons and recording the activity from a downstream brain area, one can establish the sign and strength of a feedforward connection. One challenge is that there are virtually limitless patterns that can be used to stimulate a presynaptic brain area. Functional influences on downstream brain areas can depend not just on whether presynaptic neurons were activated, but how they were activated. Corticofugal axons from the auditory cortex (ACtx) heavily innervate the auditory tectum, the inferior colliculus (IC). Here, we sought to determine whether different modes of corticocollicular activation could titrate the strength of feedforward modulation of sound processing in IC neurons. Approach. We used multi-channel electrophysiology and optogenetics to record from multiple regions of the IC in awake head-fixed mice while optogenetically stimulating ACtx neurons expressing Chronos, an ultra-fast channelrhodopsin. To identify cortical activation patterns associated with the strongest effects on IC firing rates, we employed a closed-loop evolutionary optimization procedure that tailored the voltage command signal sent to the laser based on spike feedback from single IC neurons. Main results. Within minutes, our evolutionary search procedure converged on ACtx stimulation configurations that produced more effective and widespread enhancement of IC unit activity than generic activation parameters. Cortical modulation of midbrain spiking was bi-directional, as the evolutionary search procedure could be programmed to converge on activation patterns that either suppressed or enhanced sound-evoked IC firing rate. Significance. This study introduces a closed-loop optimization procedure to probe functional connections between brain areas. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of descending feedback projections on subcortical sensory processing can vary both in sign and degree depending on how cortical neurons are activated in time.},

	abstract = {Contemporary auditory prostheses ("cochlear implants") employ arrays of stimulating electrodes implanted in the scala tympani of the cochlea. Such arrays have been implanted in some 100,000 profoundly or severely deaf people worldwide and arguably are the most successful of present-day neural prostheses. Nevertheless, most implant users show poor understanding of speech in noisy backgrounds, poor pitch recognition, and poor spatial hearing, even when using bilateral implants. Many of these limitations can be attributed to the remote location of stimulating electrodes relative to excitable cochlear neural elements. That is, a scala tympani electrode array lies within a bony compartment filled with electrically conductive fluid. Moreover, scala tympani arrays typically do not extend to the apical turn of the cochlea in which low frequencies are represented. In the present study, we have tested in an animal model an alternative to the conventional cochlear implant: a multielectrode array implanted directly into the auditory nerve. We monitored the specificity of stimulation of the auditory pathway by recording extracellular unit activity at 32 sites along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus. The results demonstrate the activation of specific auditory nerve populations throughout essentially the entire frequency range that is represented by characteristic frequencies in the inferior colliculus. Compared to conventional scala tympani stimulation, thresholds for neural excitation are as much as 50-fold lower and interference between electrodes stimulated simultaneously is markedly reduced. The results suggest that if an intraneural stimulating array were incorporated into an auditory prosthesis system for humans, it could offer substantial improvement in hearing replacement compared to contemporary cochlear implants.},

House - and more than 50 years after placement of the first CI - offers a precise account of the early experimental period. Objective: To clarify the first steps in the development of the CI, ie, an electrical stimulating device partially inserted into the cochlea. Evidence Review: Literature review based on published data, oral history material, interviews, and written contact with protagonists. Findings: The first CI was implanted by William House and John Doyle of Los Angeles, California, in 1961. In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert White of Stanford University, Stanford, California, placed a 6-channel electrode through the promontory and vestibule directly into the modiolus. The next step in the development of the CI was its clinical trial on a cohort of patients. Robin Michelson, Robert Schindler, and Michael Merzenich at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted these experiments in 1970 and 1971. In 1973, the first international conference on the "electrical stimulation of the acoustic nerve as a treatment for profound sensorineural deafness in man" was organized in San Francisco. At the same time, Claude Henry Chouard in France and Graeme Clark in Australia began their research. The final step in the establishment of CI as a clinically feasible technology involved the independent evaluation of implant users. The first such evaluation - the result of a 1975 request from the National Institutes of Health - was published in 1977 by Robert Bilger and coworkers at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Conclusions and Relevance: Inspired by French experiments with electrode implantation at the VIII nerve, the initial practical development of the CI is nonetheless a Californian story, divided between the House group at Los Angeles and teams at Stanford University and UCSF. ©2013 American Medical Association.

	abstract = {Primary sensory cortex integrates sensory information from afferent feedforward thalamocortical projection systems and convergent intracortical microcircuits. Both input systems have been demonstrated to provide different aspects of sensory information. Here we have used high-density recordings of laminar current source density (CSD) distributions in primary auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils in combination with pharmacological silencing of cortical activity and analysis of the residual CSD, to dissociate the feedforward thalamocortical contribution and the intracortical contribution to spectral integration. We found a temporally highly precise integration of both types of inputs when the stimulation frequency was in close spectral neighborhood of the best frequency of the measurement site, in which the overlap between both inputs is maximal. Local intracortical connections provide both directly feedforward excitatory and modulatory input from adjacent cortical sites, which determine how concurrent afferent inputs are integrated. Through separate excitatory horizontal projections, terminating in cortical layers II/III, information about stimulus energy in greater spectral distance is provided even over long cortical distances. These projections effectively broaden spectral tuning width. Based on these data, we suggest a mechanism of spectral integration in primary auditory cortex that is based on temporally precise interactions of afferent thalamocortical inputs and different short-and long-range intracortical networks. The proposed conceptual framework allows integration of different and partly controversial anatomical and physiological models of spectral integration in the literature.

	abstract = {The design of contemporary multichannel cochlear implants is predicated on the presumption that they activate multiple independent sectors of the auditory nerve array. The independence of these channels, however, is limited by the spread of activation from each intracochlear electrode across the auditory nerve array. In this study, we evaluated factors that influence intracochlear spread of activation using two types of intracochlear electrodes: (1) a clinical-type device consisting of a linear series of ring contacts positioned along a silicon elastomer carrier, and (2) a pair of visually placed (VP) ball electrodes that could be positioned independently relative to particular intracochlear structures, e.g., the spiral ganglion. Activation spread was estimated by recording multineuronal evoked activity along the cochleotopic axis of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). This activity was recorded using silicon-based single-shank, 16-site recording probes, which were fixed within the ICC at a depth defined by responses to acoustic tones. After deafening, electric stimuli consisting of single biphasic electric pulses were presented with each electrode type in various stimulation configurations (monopolar, bipolar, tripolar) and/or various electrode orientations (radial, off-radial, longitudinal). The results indicate that monopolar (MP) stimulation with either electrode type produced widepread excitation across the ICC. Bipolar (BP) stimulation with banded pairs of electrodes oriented longitudinally produced activation that was somewhat less broad than MP stimulation, and tripolar (TP) stimulation produced activation that was more restricted than MP or BP stimulation. Bipolar stimulation with radially oriented pairs of VP ball electrodes produced the most restricted activation. The activity patterns evoked by radial VP balls were comparable to those produced by pure tones in normal-hearing animals. Variations in distance between radially oriented VP balls had little effect on activation spread, although increases in interelectrode spacing tended to reduce thresholds. Bipolar stimulation with longitudinally oriented VP electrodes produced broad activation that tended to broaden as the separation between electrodes increased.},

	abstract = {Introduction Tinnitus may have a very severe impact on the quality of life. Unfortunately, for many patients, a satisfactory treatment modality is lacking. The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) was originally indicated for hearing restoration in patients with non-functional cochlear nerves, for example, in neurofibromatosis type II. In analogy to a cochlear implant (CI), it has been demonstrated that an ABI may reduce tinnitus as a beneficial side effect. For tinnitus treatment, an ABI may have an advantage over a CI, as cochlear implantation can harm inner ear structures due to its invasiveness, while an ABI is presumed to not damage anatomical structures. This is the first study to implant an ABI to investigate its effect on intractable tinnitus. Methods and analysis In this pilot study, 10 adults having incapacitating unilateral intractable tinnitus and ipsilateral severe hearing loss will have an ABI implanted. The ABI is switched on 6 weeks after implantation, followed by several fitting sessions aimed at finding an optimal stimulation strategy. The primary outcome will be the change in Tinnitus Functioning Index. Secondary outcomes will be tinnitus burden and quality of life (using Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires), tinnitus characteristics (using Visual Analogue Scale, a tinnitus analysis), safety, audiometric and vestibular function. The end point is set at 1 year after implantation. Follow-up will continue until 5 years after implantation. Ethics and dissemination The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands (METc 2015/479). The trial is registered at www.clinicialtrials.gov and will be updated if amendments are made. Results of this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences. Trial registration number NCT02630589. Trial status Inclusion of first patient in November 2017. Data collection is in progress. Trial is open for further inclusion.

	abstract = {Introduction:It was previously demonstrated that tinnitus due to profound unilateral hearing loss can be treated by the use of electrical stimulation via a cochlear implant (CI) with long-lasting positive effects. In cases where patients are not suitable for cochlear implantation due to aplasia/hypoplasia, cochlear malformations etc., an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be a solution. While auditory performance with ABI is well investigated, it is currently unknown whether stimulation through ABI also renders tinnitus reduction in patients with incapacitating tinnitus. The current case study reports on the subjective tinnitus perception during a 5-year follow-up period. In addition, a first H215O PET imaging study in an ABI patient is carried out revealing underlying neural substrates of tinnitus.Methods:A 56-year-old male single-sided deaf patient with incapacitating tinnitus received an ABI after insufficient auditory performances and only minor tinnitus reduction with CI. Audiological follow-up was carried out during a 5-year follow-up period comprising pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-quiet testing, speech-in-noise testing, tinnitus questionnaires (tinnitus questionnaire and numeric rating scale) and the HISQUI19 questionnaire. To investigate the neural substrates of tinnitus in this subject, H215O PET tomography scans were acquired in three different conditions: 1) ABI switched off which was considered as the resting-state measurement rendering the loudest possible tinnitus for the patient (ABI OFF); 2) ABI switched on causing a small suppression of tinnitus due to electrical stimulation (ABI ON); 3) ABI switched on and 70dB SPL white noise presented directly to the external audio processor through a direct audio cable providing the maximum tinnitus suppression for the patient (NOISE).Results:Subjectively the patient reported a significant tinnitus reduction after implantation which remained stable over time with a decrease in tinnitus questionnaire from grade 4 to grade 2 and a 50\% reduction in the numeric rating scale (from 8 to 4) during the 5-year period. Comparing the ABI OFF and ABI ON conditions, significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was observed in brain areas involved in the salience network showing already suppression of tinnitus only by electrical stimulation in the absence of auditory stimuli. The NOISE condition showed relatively decreased rCBF in the insula (as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex) as compared with the ABI OFF condition. Abnormally activated areas comprising the salience network may have been significantly suppressed by the NOISE condition both by acoustic and electrical stimulations of the auditory pathway. Moreover, the NOISE condition showed significantly decreased rCBF in the parahippocampus as compared with the ABI OFF condition. This finding supports the idea of distinct tinnitus generators depending on the amount of hearing loss.Conclusion:The reduction of tinnitus in the current ABI subject may be attributable to partial peripheral reafferentation-induced deactivation of the parahippocampus-based tinnitus generator as well as the salience network. Further validation is required by the use of a follow-up study with a larger number of subjects.},

	abstract = {Amplitude modulation (AM) is a pervasive feature of natural sounds. Neural detection and processing of modulation cues is behaviourally important across species. Although most ecologically relevant sounds are not fully modulated, physiological studies have usually concentrated on fully modulated (100\% modulation depth) signals. Psychoacoustic experiments mainly operate at low modulation depths, around detection threshold ({\textasciitilde}5\% AM). We presented sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones, systematically varying modulation depth between zero and 100\%, at a range of modulation frequencies, to anaesthetised guinea-pigs while recording spikes from neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). The cochlear nucleus is the site of the first synapse in the central auditory system. At this locus significant signal processing occurs with respect to representation of AM signals. Spike trains were analysed in terms of the vector strength of spike synchrony to the amplitude envelope. Neurons showed either low-pass or band-pass temporal modulation transfer functions, with the proportion of band-pass responses increasing with increasing sound level. The proportion of units showing a band-pass response varies with unit type: sustained chopper (CS) {\textgreater} transient chopper (CT) {\textgreater} primary-like (PL). Spike synchrony increased with increasing modulation depth. At the lowest modulation depth (6\%), significant spike synchrony was only observed near to the unit's best modulation frequency for all unit types tested. Modulation tuning therefore became sharper with decreasing modulation depth. AM detection threshold was calculated for each individual unit as a function of modulation frequency. Chopper units have significantly better AM detection thresholds than do primary-like units. AM detection threshold is significantly worse at 40 dB vs. 10 dB above pure-tone spike rate threshold. Mean modulation detection thresholds for sounds 10 dB above pure-tone spike rate threshold at best modulation frequency are (95\% CI) 11.6\% (10.0-13.1) for PL units, 9.8\% (8.2-11.5) for CT units, and 10.8\% (8.4-13.2) for CS units. The most sensitive guinea-pig VCN single unit AM detection thresholds are similar to human psychophysical performance ({\textasciitilde}3\% AM), while the mean neurometric thresholds approach whole animal behavioural performance ({\textasciitilde}10\% AM). © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Response rates of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) to electric pulse trains change over time, reflecting substantial spike-rate adaptation that depends on stimulus parameters. We hypothesize that adaptation affects the representation of amplitude-modulated pulse trains used by cochlear prostheses to transmit speech information to the auditory system. We recorded cat ANF responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) trains with 5,000 pulse/s carriers. Stimuli delivered by a monopolar intracochlear electrode had fixed modulation frequency (100 Hz) and depth (10\%). ANF responses were assessed by spike-rate measures, while representation of modulation was evaluated by vector strength (VS) and the fundamental component of the fast Fourier transform (F0 amplitude). These measures were assessed across the 400 ms duration of pulse-train stimuli, a duration relevant to speech stimuli. Different stimulus levels were explored and responses were categorized into four spike-rate groups to assess level effects across ANFs. The temporal pattern of rate adaptation to modulated trains was similar to that of unmodulated trains, but with less rate adaptation. VS to the modulator increased over time and tended to saturate at lower spike rates, while F0 amplitude typically decreased over time for low driven rates and increased for higher driven rates. VS at moderate and high spike rates and degree of F0 amplitude temporal changes at low and moderate spike rates were positively correlated with the degree of rate adaptation. Thus, high-rate carriers will modify the ANF representation of the modulator over time. As the VS and F0 measures were sensitive to adaptation-related changes over different spike-rate ranges, there is value in assessing both measures. © 2010 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.},

All the GFPs we used are the mutant forms of a common wild phenotype. The pBIEGFP expressed enhanced GFP (EGFP). The pRSGFP and pSG5GFP expressed red shift GFP (RSGFP). The RSGFP gene in pSG5GFP was driven by a strong SV40 promoter and showed at least 20-fold higher RSGFP expression by western blot analysis. Despite of the variation in the levels of GFP expression, many GFP expressing cells contracted, rounded-up, and died, which was confirmed by decreasing luciferase activity. CPP32 activity and flow cytometric analyses further demonstrate that cells expressing GFP underwent apoptosis. Our observation is contradictory to other reports that GFP is nontoxic to the cells. Most importantly, this paper shows for the first time the link between expression of GFP and induction of apoptosis.

These ITD cues are not encoded in commonly used envelope-based stimulation strategies for cochlear implants (CIs) using high pulse rates. However, ITD sensitivity can be improved by adding extra pulses with short inter-pulse intervals (SIPIs) in unmodulated high-rate trains. Here, we investigated whether this improvement also applies to amplitude-modulated (AM) high-rate pulse trains. To this end, we systematically varied the temporal position of SIPI pulses within the envelope cycle (SIPI phase), the fundamental frequency (F0) of AM (125 Hz and 250 Hz), and AM depth (from 0.1 to 0.9). Stimuli were presented at an interaurally place-matched electrode pair at a reference pulse rate of 1000 pulses/s. Participants performed an ITD-based left/right discrimination task. SIPI insertion resulted in improved ITD sensitivity throughout the range of modulation depths and for both male and female F0s. The improvements were largest for insertion at and around the envelope peak.

Current in vivo models involve small animals not suitable for evaluating full-sized CIs nor are prohibitively expensive nonhuman primates. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vivo model of cochlear implantation in sheep.Methods:Eight adult, female sheep were implanted with full-sized CIs from three manufacturers using a retrofacial approach to the round window. Partial electrode insertions were performed to a depth of 10 to 12 mm before closure. Round window electrocochleography (ECoG) and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were conducted during and after surgery. Following a 30-day implantation, cochleae were explanted and imaged using both x-ray microscopy and histology.Results:The surgery was well tolerated although limited complications were observed in three of eight sheep. Electrode insertions were up to 12 mm before insertion resistance noted. ECoG and ABR responses were reduced postimplantation, reflecting changes in cochlear mechanics due to the presence of the implant, and/or insertion trauma. Histological and radiological image analysis showed the presence of intracochlear fibrosis as well as one instance of tip fold-over.Conclusions:The use of sheep presents a feasible live-Animal model to study cochlear implantations. Full-sized implants as well as surgical techniques can be evaluated on functional outcomes such as ABR and ECoG as well as histological markers for residual hearing including intracochlear fibrosis. Use of this model and surgical approach has potential to evaluate CIs and surgical techniques in both the acute and chronic setting.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological mapping was used to study frequency representation in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the mouse. In the lateral nucleus (LN) only part of the frequency range of hearing was represented and tonotopicity was separate from that in the rest of the IC. Highest frequencies occupied the medial part (M) of the central nucleus (CN). A single complete representation of the hearing range was present only if representations in the dorsal cortex (plus dorsomedial nucleus) and CN (including M) were combined. Continuous isofrequency planes making up these nuclei (without the lateral part of the CN) were reconstructed. They tilted from medial to lateral and from caudal to rostral. The steepness of the slopes increased from caudal to rostral and from dorsal to ventral (i.e., with increasing frequency). Isofrequency planes had similar angles of deviation from the horizontal plane as described for dendritic laminae in the CN. Differences of mapping in the lateral part of the CN from that in the rest of the CN could be explained by the different organization of laminae in this part. The relative e mounts of IC depth and volume occupied by parts of the mouse audible frequency range were quantified. Frequency representation along IC depth wan not proportional to that along cochlear length. Compared with the relative density of afferent nerve fiber supply within given frequency ranges represented along the basilar membrane, there is a relative under‐representation in the IC up to 15–20 kHz and an over‐representation of higher frequencies. Highest absolute tone sensitivity (lowest threshold) was found in neurons forming a column (running perpendicular to isofrequency planes) in the center of the IC. Results are discussed with regard to frequency representation, intrinsic neuronal organization, and functional segregation in the IC of mammals. Copyright © 1985 Alan R. Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) users with a prelingual onset of hearing loss show poor sensitivity to interaural time differences (ITDs), an important cue for sound localization and speech reception in noise. Similarly, neural ITD sensitivity in the inferior colliculus (IC) of neonatally-deafened animals is degraded compared with animals deafened as adults. Here, we show that chronic bilateral CI stimulation during development can partly reverse the effect of early-onset deafness on ITD sensitivity. The prevalence of ITD sensitive neurons was restored to the level of adult-deaf (AD) rabbits in the early-deaf rabbits of both sexes that received chronic stimulation and behavioral training with wearable bilateral sound processors during development. We also found a partial improvement in neural ITD sensitivity in the early-deaf and stimulated rabbits compared with unstimulated rabbits. In contrast, chronic CI stimulation did not improve temporal coding in early-deaf rabbits. The present study is the first report showing functional restoration of ITD sensitivity with CI stimulation in single neurons and highlights the importance of auditory experience during development on the maturation of binaural circuitry.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms underlying age-related changes in speech perception are still unclear, most likely multifactorial and often can be difficult to parse out from the effects of hearing loss. Age-related changes in temporal resolution (i.e., the ability to track rapid changes in sounds) have long been associated with speech perception declines exhibited by many older individuals. The goals of this study were as follows: (1) to assess age-related changes in temporal resolution in cochlear implant (CI) users, and (2) to examine the impact of changes in temporal resolution and cognition on the perception of speech in noise. In this population, it is possible to bypass the cochlea and stimulate the auditory nerve directly in a noninvasive way. Additionally, CI technology allows for manipulation of the temporal properties of a signal without changing its spectrum. DESIGN: Twenty postlingually deafened Nucleus CI users took part in this study. They were divided into groups of younger (18 to 40 years) and older (68 to 82 years) participants. A cross-sectional study design was used. The speech processor was bypassed and a mid-array electrode was used for stimulation. We compared peripheral and central physiologic measures of temporal resolution with perceptual measures obtained using similar stimuli. Peripherally, temporal resolution was assessed with measures of the rate of recovery of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP), evoked using a single pulse and a pulse train as maskers. The acoustic change complex (ACC) to gaps in pulse trains was used to assess temporal resolution more centrally. Psychophysical gap detection thresholds were also obtained. Cognitive assessment included two tests of processing speed (Symbol Search and Coding) and one test of working memory (Digit Span Test). Speech perception was tested in the presence of background noise (QuickSIN test). A correlational design was used to explore the relationship between temporal resolution, cognition, and speech perception. RESULTS: The only metric that showed significant age effects in temporal processing was the ECAP recovery function recorded using pulse train maskers. Younger participants were found to have faster rates of neural recovery following presentation of pulse trains than older participants. Age was not found to have a significant effect on speech perception. When results from both groups were combined, digit span was the only measure significantly correlated with speech perception performance. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of CI users, few effects of advancing age on temporal resolution were evident. While this finding would be consistent with a general lack of aging effects on temporal resolution, it is also possible that aging effects are influenced by processing peripheral to the auditory nerve, which is bypassed by the CI. However, it is known that cross-fiber neural synchrony is improved with electrical (as opposed to acoustic) stimulation. This change in neural synchrony may, in turn, make temporal cues more robust/perceptible to all CI users. Future studies involving larger sample sizes should be conducted to confirm these findings. Results of this study also add to the growing body of literature that suggests that working memory is important for the perception of degraded speech.},

	doi = {10.3389/fneur.2014.00203},
	abstract = {Tinnitus is often identified in animal models by using the gap prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle. Impaired gap detection following acoustic over-exposure (AOE) is thought to be caused by tinnitus "filling in" the gap, thus, reducing its salience. This presumably involves altered perception, and could conceivably be caused by changes at the level of the neocortex, i.e., cortical reorganization. Alternatively, reduced gap detection ability might reflect poorer temporal processing in the brainstem, caused by AOE; in which case, impaired gap detection would not be a reliable indicator of tinnitus. We tested the latter hypothesis by examining gap detection in inferior colliculus (IC) neurons following AOE. Seven of nine unilaterally noise-exposed guinea pigs exhibited behavioral evidence of tinnitus. In these tinnitus animals, neural gap detection thresholds (GDTs) in the IC significantly increased in response to broadband noise stimuli, but not to pure tones or narrow-band noise. In addition, when IC neurons were sub-divided according to temporal response profile (onset vs. sustained firing patterns), we found a significant increase in the proportion of onset-type responses after AOE. Importantly, however, GDTs were still considerably shorter than gap durations commonly used in objective behavioral tests for tinnitus. These data indicate that the neural changes observed in the IC are insufficient to explain deficits in behavioral gap detection that are commonly attributed to tinnitus. The subtle changes in IC neuron response profiles following AOE warrant further investigation.},

Gap detection is a paradigm to study age-related temporal processing deficits, which is assumed to be determined primarily by the latter. However, peripheral hearing loss is a strong confounding factor when using gap detection to measure temporal processing. In this study, we used mice from the CAST line, which is known to maintain excellent peripheral hearing, to rule out any contribution of peripheral hearing loss to gap detection performance. We employed an operant Go/No-go paradigm to obtain psychometric functions of gap in noise (GIN) detection at young and middle age. Besides, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and multiunit recordings in the auditory cortex (AC) in order to disentangle the processing stages of gap detection. We found detection thresholds around 0.6 ms in all measurement modalities. Detection thresholds did not increase with age. In the ABR, GIN stimuli are coded as onset responses to the noise that follows the gap, strikingly similar to the ABR of noise bursts in silence (NBIS). The simplicity of the neural representation of the gap together with the preservation of detection threshold in aged CAST mice suggests that GIN detection in the mouse is primarily determined by peripheral, not central processing.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant listeners receive auditory stimulation through amplitude-modulated electric pulse trains. Auditory nerve studies in animals demonstrate qualitatively different patterns of firing elicited by low versus high pulse rates, suggesting that stimulus pulse rate might influence the transmission of temporal information through the auditory pathway. We tested in awake guinea pigs the temporal acuity of auditory cortical neurons for gaps in cochlear implant pulse trains. Consistent with results using anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity improved with increasing pulse rates. Unlike the anesthetized condition, however, cortical neurons responded in the awake state to multiple distinct features of the gap-containing pulse trains, with the dominant features varying with stimulus pulse rate. Responses to the onset of the trailing pulse train (Trail- ON) provided the most sensitive gap detection at 1,017 and 4,069 pulse-per-second (pps) rates, particularly for short (25 ms) leading pulse trains. In contrast, under conditions of 254 pps rate and long (200 ms) leading pulse trains, a sizeable fraction of units demonstrated greater temporal acuity in the form of robust responses to the offsets of the leading pulse train (Lead-OFF). Finally, TONIC responses exhibited decrements in firing rate during gaps, but were rarely the most sensitive feature. Unlike results from anesthetized conditions,temporal acuity of the most sensitive units was nearly as sharp for brief as for long leading bursts. The differences in stimulus coding across pulse rates likely originate from pulse rate-dependent variations in adaptation in the auditory nerve. Two marked differences from responses to acoustic stimulation were: first, Trail-ON responses to 4,069 pps trains encoded substantially shorter gaps than have been observed with acoustic stimuli; and second, the Lead-OFF gap coding seen for G15 ms gaps in 254 pps stimuli is not seen in responses to sounds. The current results may help to explain why moderate pulse rates around 1,000 pps are favored by many cochlear implant listeners. © 2011 The Author(s).

Here, we present a simple but powerful setup based on wireless, near-field power transfer and miniaturized, thin, flexible optoelectronic implants, for complete optical control in a variety of behavioral paradigms. The devices combine subdermal magnetic coil antennas connected to microscale, injectable light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with the ability to operate at wavelengths ranging from UV to blue, green-yellow, and red.

The profiles of the dynamic, broadband output ILDs were very different from the dynamic, broadband input ILD profiles. Short-duration, high-velocity head movements resulted in dynamic output ILDs that continued to change after head movement had stopped.

Using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem response (eABR) recordings in mice, we found that less charge, but higher current level amplitude, is needed to evoke responses with ramped shapes that are similar in amplitude to responses obtained with rectangular shapes. The most charge-efficient pulse shape had a rising ramp over both phases, supporting findings from previous in vitro studies. This was also true for longer phase durations. Our study presents the first physiological data on CI-stimulation with ramped pulse shapes. By reducing charge consumption ramped pulses have the potential to produce more battery-efficient CIs and may open new perspectives for designing other efficient neural implants in the future.},

Results are based on light microscopic examination of surface specimens and serial sections and on three‐dimensional computer reconstruction. The cochleae have 1.75–2.2 coils. The length of the basilar membrane varies from 6.0 to 12.1 mm. Mean density of outer hair cells ranges between 363 and 411, inner hair cells 98 and 121, neurons 1,230 and 1,760 per 1 mm. Following parameters change from base to apex: basilar membrane width 66.0 (±8.2) to 175.0 (±24.7) μm, basilar membrane thickness 17.0 (±2.6) to (±0.1) μm, width of triad of outer hair cells 13.2 (±0.7) to 28.8 (±4.4) μm. The given numbers are mean “murid” values (with respective standard deviations). Maximum of dimensions of scalae is located at 10–15\%, that of density of outer hair cells at 65\%, density of inner hair cells at 2.8 mm, maximum of innervation density at 40–60\% from the base. The following parameters are correlated with pinna size: length and maximum width of basilar membrane, dimensions of scalae, total number of receptors, and probably resolution capabilities. The following parameters are correlated with body size: maximum width of traid of outer hair cells, density and total number of neurons, ratio of neurons to receptors, apicobasal difference in basilar membrane stiffness and width of triad of triad of outer hair cells; inversely proportional is receptor density and ratio of outer to inner hair cells and probably low‐frequency cut‐off. Thickness, and minimum width of basilar membrane and triad of outer hair cells and probably high‐frequency cutoff are species‐specific and independent of pinna or body size. The parameters mentioned indicate that the examined murids are acoustically unspecialized mammals and their cochleae approximate the generalized plan for a mammalian cochlea. Differences between domesticated and wild murids are stated. Copyright © 1988 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Intratympanic placement of drugs and permeation via the round- and oval window are established methods for local pharmaceutical treatment. Mechanisms of drug uptake and pathways for distribution within the inner ear are hard to predict. The complex microanatomy with fluid-filled spaces separated by tight- and leaky barriers compose various compartments that connect via active and passive transport mechanisms. Here we provide a review on the inner ear architecture at light- and electron microscopy level, relevant for drug delivery. Focus is laid on the human inner ear architecture. Some new data add information on the human inner ear fluid spaces generated with high resolution microcomputed tomography at 15 μm resolution. Perilymphatic spaces are connected with the central modiolus by active transport mechanisms of mesothelial cells that provide access to spiral ganglion neurons. Reports on leaky barriers between scala tympani and the so-called cortilymph compartment likely open the best path for hair cell targeting. The complex barrier system of tight junction proteins such as occludins, claudins and tricellulin isolates the endolymphatic space for most drugs. Comparison of relevant differences of barriers, target cells and cell types involved in drug spread between main animal models and humans shall provide some translational aspects for inner ear drug applications.},

The resulting tactile feedbacks significantly help the comprehension of anatomical details, especially the spatial relations between structures. In this regard, they proved to be more effective than conventional 2D imaging and 3D virtual models. To date, an increasing number of applications have been successfully tested in many surgical disciplines, extending the range of possible uses to pre-operative planning, counselling with patients, education of students and residents, surgical training, intraoperative navigation and others; in recent years, 3D printing was also employed for creating surgical tools and reproducing anatomical parts to be used, respectively, as templates or guides for specific tasks of the surgery and individualized implantable materials in reconstructive procedures. Future expectations concern on one side the reduction of manufacturing costs and time to further increase the accessibility of 3D printing, while on the other the development of novel techniques and materials suitable for 3D printing of biological structures by which recreating the architecture and functionality of real human organs and tissues.},

A literature search of PubMed, Ovid and Scopus was conducted using the following terms: stereolithography, 3D printing, computer aided rapid prototyping, surgical guide, guided endodontic surgery, guided endodontic access, additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, autotransplantation rapid prototyping, CAD, CAM. Inclusion criteria were articles in the English language documenting endodontic applications of 3D printing. Fifty-one articles met inclusion criteria and were utilized. The endodontic literature on 3D printing is generally limited to case reports and pre-clinical studies. Documented solutions to endodontic challenges include: guided access with pulp canal obliteration, applications in autotransplantation, pre-surgical planning and educational modelling and accurate location of osteotomy perforation sites. Acquisition of technical expertise and equipment within endodontic practices present formidable obstacles to widespread deployment within the endodontic specialty.

Using fNIRS, 15 experienced CI users and 14 normal-hearing participants were imaged while presented with either visual speech or auditory speech. Brain activation was measured from the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal lobe in both hemispheres, including the language-associated regions. In response to visual speech, the activation levels of CI users in an a priori region of interest (ROI)—the left superior temporal gyrus or sulcus—were negatively correlated with auditory speech understanding. This result suggests that increased cross-modal activity in the auditory cortex is predictive of poor auditory speech understanding. In another two ROIs, in which CI users showed significantly different mean activation levels in response to auditory speech compared with normal-hearing listeners, activation levels were significantly negatively correlated with CI users’ auditory speech understanding. These ROIs were located in the right anterior temporal lobe (including a portion of prefrontal lobe) and the left middle superior temporal lobe. In conclusion, fNIRS successfully revealed activation patterns in CI users associated with their auditory speech understanding.},

This may be attributable to inadequate neural selectivity of available intracochlear electrodes, caused by current spread and electrode interactions. Attempts to improve electrode selectivity have included manipulating the number and configuration of electrodes that are stimulated at any one time, displacing perilymph from the cochlea to restrict current flow along the cochlea, and reducing the distance between electrodes and neurons. One experimental approach by which the distance between neurons and electrodes may be reduced is to use neurotrophic factors to promote the regeneration of the peripheral dendrites of auditory neurons and guide them towards intracochlear electrodes. The likely requirements of a system for regenerating auditory neurons towards the cochlear electrode include either a stable release of neurotrophin, or transient neurotrophin followed by electrical stimulation; a close proximity of electrode to osseous spiral lamina or a polymer to bridge the gap between the two; guidance signals to attract neurons towards the electrode; patterning of the electrode surface to direct dendrites to electrode contacts and a 'stop' signal to arrest regeneration once the electrode has been reached. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between focused-stimulation thresholds, electrode positions, and speech understanding in deaf subjects treated with a cochlear implant (CI). Focused stimulation is more selective than monopolar stimulation, which excites broad regions of the cochlea, so may be more sensitive as a probe of neural survival patterns. Focused thresholds are on average higher and more variable across electrodes than monopolar thresholds. We presume that relatively high focused thresholds are the result of larger distances between the electrodes and the neurons. Two factors are likely to contribute to this distance: (1) the physical position of electrodes relative to the modiolus, where the excitable auditory neurons are normally located, and (2) the pattern of neural survival along the length of the cochlea, since local holes in the neural population will increase the distance between an electrode and the nearest neurons. Electrode-to-modiolus distance was measured from high-resolution CT scans of the cochleae of CI users whose focused-stimulation thresholds were also measured. A hierarchical set of linear models of electrode-to-modiolus distance versus threshold showed a significant increase in threshold with electrode-to-modiolus distance (average slope = 11 dB/mm). The residual of these models was hypothesized to reflect neural survival in each subject. Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) word scores were significantly correlated with the within-subject variance of threshold (r2 = 0.82), but not with within-subject variance of electrode distance (r2 = 0.03). Speech understanding also significantly correlated with how well distance explained each subject's threshold data (r2 = 0.63). That is, subjects with focused thresholds that were well described by electrode position had better speech scores. Our results suggest that speech understanding is highly impacted by individual patterns of neural survival and that these patterns manifest themselves in how well (or poorly) electrode position predicts focused thresholds. © 2014 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.},

	abstract = {This study extended the findings of Ketten et al. [Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. Suppl. 175:1-16 (1998)] by estimating the three-dimensional (3D) cochlear lengths, electrode array intracochlear insertion depths, and characteristic frequency ranges for 13 more Nucleus-22 implant recipients based on in vivo computed tomography (CT) scans. Array insertion depths were correlated with NU-6 word scores (obtained one year after SPEAK strategy use) by these patients and the 13 who used the SPEAK strategy from the Ketten et al. study. For these 26 patients, the range of cochlear lengths was 29.1-37.4 mm. Array insertion depth range was 11.9-25.9 mm, and array insertion depth estimated from the surgeon's report was 1.14 mm longer than CT-based estimates. Given the assumption that the human hearing range is fixed (20-20,000 Hz) regardless of cochlear length, characteristic frequencies at the most apical electrode (estimated with Greenwood's equation [Greenwood DD (1990) A cochlcar frequency - position function of several species - 29 years later. J Acoust. Soc. Am. 33:1344-1356] and a patient-specific constant as) ranged from 308 to 3674 Hz. Patients' NU-6 word scores were significantly correlated with insertion depth as a percentage of total cochlear length (R = 0.452; r2 = 0.204; p = 0.020), suggesting that part of the variability in word recognition across implant recipients can be accounted for by the position of the electrode array in the cochlea. However, NU-6 scores ranged from 4\% to 81\% correct for patients with array insertion depths between 4\% and 68\% of total cochlear length. Lower scores appeared related to low spiral ganglion cell survival (e.g., lues), aberrant current paths that produced facial nerve stimulation by apical electrodes (i.e., otosclerosis), central auditory processing difficulty, below-average verbal abilities, and early Alzheimer's disease. Higher scores appeared related to patients' high-average to above-average verbal abilities. Because most patients' scores increased with SPEAK use, it is hypothesized that they accommodated to the shift in frequency of incoming sound to a higher pitch percept with the implant than would normally be perceived acoustically.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate whether speech understanding in auditory brainstem implant (ABI) users who have a tumor pathology could be improved by the selection of a subset of electrodes that were appropriately pitch ranked and distinguishable. It was hypothesized that disordered pitch or spectral percepts and channel interactions may contribute significantly to the poor outcomes in most ABI users. Design: A single-subject design was used with five participants. Pitch ranking information for all electrodes in the patients' clinic maps was obtained using a pitch ranking task and previous pitch ranking information from clinic sessions. A multidimensional scaling task was used to evaluate the stimulus space evoked by stimuli on the same set of electrodes. From this information, a subset of four to six electrodes was chosen and a new map was created, using just this subset, that the subjects took home for 1 month's experience. Closed-set consonant and vowel perception and sentences in quiet were tested at three sessions: with the clinic map before the test map was given, after 1 month with the test map, and after an additional 2 weeks with their clinic map. Results: The results of the pitch ranking and multidimensional scaling procedures confirmed that the ABI users did not have a well-ordered set of percepts related to electrode position, thus supporting the proposal that difficulty in processing of spectral information may contribute to poor speech understanding. However, none of the subjects benefited from a map that reduced the stimulation electrode set to a smaller number of electrodes that were well ordered in place pitch. Conclusions: Although poor spectral processing may contribute to poor understanding in ABI users, it is not likely to be the sole contributor to poor outcomes.},

In the present study we investigate neural temporal mechanisms in the auditory nerve and cochlear nuclei of the pentobarbital sodium-anesthesized cat associated with the neural coding of 100\% AM tones, both in quiet and in the presence of wideband, quasi-flat-spectrum noise. The AM carrier frequency was set to the neuron's characteristic frequency (CF) and the sound pressure level (SPL) of acoustic stimuli was varied over a wide dynamic range of intensities (≤40 dB). The temporal AM-encoding capability of auditory neurons was measured by computing the synchronization coefficient (SC) of the neural response to the signal's modulation and carrier frequency. The temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) of a neuron was then computed by measuring the SC of the response to signals of variable f(mod)(50-2550 Hz). 2. Neurons in the cochlear nuclei synchronize on average more highly to the modulation frequency than fibers of comparable CF, threshold, and spontaneous rate in the auditory nerve. The disparity in performance is greatest at high SPLs and low signal-to-noise ratios. However, there is a significant degree of diversity in AM-encoding capability among neurons in both the cochlear nuclei and auditory nerve. Among auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), low- and medium-spontaneous-rate (SR) units (SR {\textless}18 spike/s) phase-lock with greater precision than comparable high-SR units at any given frequency, particularly at moderate to high SPLs, consistent with previous studies. 3. The phase-locking capabilities of neurons in the cochlear nucleus are considerably more variable than in the auditory nerve. Moreover, the variability itself depends on two distinct measures of phase-locking performance. Most ANFs are capable of phase-locking to frequencies as high as 3-4 kHz. In the cochlear nucleus many unit types do not phase-lock to modulation frequencies {\textgreater}1 kHz. As a result, phase-locking performance is measured on the basis of two parameters, maximum synchronization, irrespective of stimulus frequency, and the upper frequency limit for significant phase-locking. 4. Cochlear nucleus neurons may be divided into three distinct groups on the basis of maximum synchronization capability. In group 1 are the primary-like (PL) units of the anteroventral division, whose phase-locking capabilities are comparable with those of high-SR ANFs. A second group, comprising the chopper (C), onset-L (O(L)) and pauser-buildup (P/B) unit types, exhibits phase-locking capability superior to that of PL units in response to low-frequency tones and AM signals and roughly equal to that of low-SR ANFs. A third group, consisting of the onset-chopper (O(C)) and primary-like-with-notch (PL(N)) units, exhibits phase-locking capability to AM signals that is considerably enhanced relative to that of groups 1 and 2. 5. The upper frequency limit of robust phase-locked AM encoding is described by the corner and cutoff frequencies of the tMTF. These upper limits are highly correlated with characteristic frequency for ANFs (and to a lesser extent, for PL and O(L) units) with CFs {\textless}10 kHz. However, other cochlear nucleus unit response types show little if any correlation for CFs {\textgreater}2 kHz. Among high-CF units ANFs exhibit the most precise phase-locking to f(mod) {\textgreater}1.5 kHz. The average tMTF corner frequency for these units is 744 Hz. O(C), PL, and O(L) units are also capable of robustly phase-locking to f(mod) {\textgreater}1 kHz. On the other hand, C and P/B units rarely phase-lock well to f(mod) {\textgreater}600 Hz. The rank order for phase-locking capability to high f(mod) is: ANF {\textgreater} PL(N) {\textgreater} (O(L) = PL = O(C)) {\textgreater} C {\textgreater} P/B. 6. The ability to encode f(mod) degrades appreciably at higher SPLs for most ANFs and cochlear nuclei units. However, phase-locking performance of ANFs shows the greatest decline with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas O(C) and P/B units exhibit the least. The latter unit types are capable of encoding f(mod) information at intensities up to ≥80 dB SPL. 7. For AM signals with component frequencies {\textless}1-2 kHz, many units in the cochlear nucleus and auditory nerve phase-lock to both the f(mod) and component frequencies. Phase-locking to the signal components reflects the ability of cells to encode the fine temporal structure of the waveform. 8. The overwhelming majority of cells in the auditory nerve and cochlear nuclei retain their capability of encoding f(mod) at all but the lowest signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting that one function of phase-locking may be to preserve modulation information under noisy background conditions. 9. The physiological mechanisms responsible for modulation coding in the cochlear nuclei are diverse. The most important factor appears to be the presence of convergent, phase-locked afferent activity from the auditory nerve, particularly in the case of O(C) units, which function in a manner analogous to 'coincidence detectors.'},

Analogous studies of the pericruciate cortex, as well as a generalization of the findings from CSDs about the intracortical processing of primary afferent information is discussed. The relationships between EEG phenomena and intracortical CSDs and their similarities with primary evoked cortical activity are presented.

Restrictive conditions for acquisition of evoked potentials are required in order to yield a one-dimensional CSD analysis that is an accurate estimate of synaptic activity. Satisfaction of these conditions was assumed in recordings of tone-burst-evoked potentials along the axis of symmetry (tonotopic) in the inferior colliculus of adult mongolian gerbils. Off-line these data were converted into distance/voltage functions. The second spatial derivatives of these functions gave a family of profiles of the spatial distribution of current source and sink densities at discrete latencies relative to the stimulus. Results indicate a frequency-dependent spatial shift in the evoked current sink of about 280 μm octave. This sink, indicative of local excitatory synaptic drive, is surrounded, both spatially and temporally, by current sources. The spatial extent of excitation as estimated from CSD analysis, compares well quantitatively with predictions from an across-neuron model that is based on single unit data. © 1987.},

	abstract = {A new method for estimation of current-source density (CSD) from local field potentials is presented. This inverse CSD (iCSD) method is based on explicit inversion of the electrostatic forward solution and can be applied to data from multielectrode arrays with various geometries. Here, the method is applied to linear-array (laminar) electrode data. Three iCSD methods are considered: the CSD is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry and be (i) localized in infinitely thin discs, (ii) step-wise constant or (iii) continuous and smoothly varying (using cubic splines) in the vertical direction. For spatially confined CSD distributions the standard CSD method, involving a discrete double derivative, is seen in model calculations to give significant estimation errors when the lateral source dimension is comparable to the size of a cortical column (less than ∼ 1 mm). Further, discontinuities in the extracellular conductivity are seen to potentially give sizable errors for even wider source distributions. The iCSD methods are seen to give excellent estimates when the correct lateral source dimension and spatial distribution of conductivity are incorporated. To illustrate the application to real data, iCSD estimates of stimulus-evoked responses measured with laminar electrodes in the rat somatosensory (barrel) cortex are compared to estimates from the standard CSD method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Bilateral cochlear implantation seeks to restore the advantages of binaural hearing to the profoundly deaf by providing binaural cues normally important for accurate sound localization and speech reception in noise. Psychophysical observations suggest that a key issue for the implementation of a successful binaural prosthesis is the ability to match the cochlear positions of stimulation channels in each ear. We used a cat model of bilateral cochlear implants with eight-electrode arrays implanted in each cochlea to develop and test a noninvasive method based on evoked potentials for matching interaural electrodes. The arrays allowed the cochlear location of stimulation to be independently varied in each ear. The binaural interaction component (BIC) of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) was used as an assay of binaural processing. BIC amplitude peaked for interaural electrode pairs at the same relative cochlear position and dropped with increasing cochlear separation in either direction. To test the hypothesis that BIC amplitude peaks when electrodes from the two sides activate maximally overlapping neural populations, we measured multiunit neural activity along the tonotopic gradient of the inferior colliculus (IC) with 16-channel recording probes and determined the spatial pattern of IC activation for each stimulating electrode. We found that the interaural electrode pairings that produced the best aligned IC activation patterns were also those that yielded maximum BIC amplitude. These results suggest that EABR measurements may provide a method for assigning frequency-channel mappings in bilateral implant recipients, such as pediatric patients, for which psychophysical measures of pitch ranking or binaural fusion are unavailable. © 2007 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.},

Am. 73, 1694-1700 (1983)] suggested that a temporal model for octave matching would predict this octave enlargement effect because, in response to pure tones, auditory-nerve interspike intervals are slightly larger than the stimulus period. In an effort to test Ohgushi's hypothesis, auditory-nerve single-unit responses to pure-tone stimuli were collected from Dial-anesthetized cats. It was found that although interspike interval distributions show clear phase-locking to the stimulus, intervals systematically deviate from integer multiples of the stimulus period. Due to refractory effects, intervals smaller than 5 msec are slightly larger than the stimulus period and deviate most for small intervals. On the other hand, first-order intervals are smaller than the stimulus period for stimulus frequencies less than 500 Hz. It is shown that this deviation is the combined effect of phase-locking and multiple spikes within one stimulus period. A model for octave matching was implemented which compares frequency estimates of two tones based on their interspike interval distributions. The model quantitatively predicts the octave enlargement effect. These results are consistent with the idea that musical pitch is derived from auditory-nerve interspike interval distributions.},

The nuclear subdivisions and major cell types can be recognised on the basis of those found in the cat, but there are some differences between the two species in the precise distribution and morphology of the neurons. The rostrodorsal part of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) contains predominantly spherical bushy cells, but these cannot be readily divided into large and small types as in the cat. Globular bushy cells are seen in the caudal region of the AVCN, but the majority occur in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN), in an area extending from the nerve root right up to the boundary of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). The octopus cells constitute a distinct region in the most dorsomedial part of the PVCN underneath the DCN. Giant cells are seen scattered around the nerve root region. Multipolar and small cells are seen throughout the non-granular regions of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) except for the octopus cell area, but occur mainly in the more rostral regions of the PVCN. Small cells occur in greatest abundance in the thin cap area at the dorsal edge of the VCN below a superficial granule cell layer. The latter covers the dorsolateral surface of the VCN, and a lamina of granule cells partially separates the PVCN from the DCN. The DCN can be divided into four layers. The outermost molecular layer (layer 1) is separated from the deeper regions by a prominent layer of granule cells (layer 2) which also contains the pyramidal cells. Molecular layer stellate cells are seen in layer 1 and a staggered row of cartwheel neurons is found at the boundary between layers 1 and 2. Layer 3 contains the basal dendrites of the pyramidal cells and some small (vertical) cells, and is innervated by the descending branches of the cochlear nerve. The deepest layer 4, which contains multipolar cells and giant cells, does not appear to receive this direct cochlear input. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

To evaluate the electrochemical properties, biological response, and surface characterization of an electrodeposited Platinum-Iridium (Pt-Ir) electrode coating on cochlear implants subjected to chronic stimulation in vivo. Approach. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge storage capacity (CSC), charge injection limit (CIL), and voltage transient (VT) impedance were measured bench-top before and after implant and in vivo. Coated Pt-Ir and uncoated Pt electrode arrays were implanted into cochlea of normal hearing rats and stimulated for ∼4 h d, 5 d week-1 for 5 weeks at levels within the normal clinical range. Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. Main results. When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p {\textless} 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p {\textless} 0.001) and CIL (p {\textless} 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p= 0.047 and p{\textless} 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p= 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. Significance. Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Free field thresholds with cochlear and brainstem implants. Surgical issues are also discussed. RESULTS: The study is descriptive in nature. Free field thresholds with each device alone and together showed good progress. One of the patients had slower progress possibly due to comorbid CHARGE syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed good progress in terms of audition with both devices.

For cochlear implant subjects, the delivery of detailed amplitude modulation information has been recently shown to result in very significant improvements in speech understanding. Several previous studies on cochlear implant subjects have reported capacities for temporal resolution rather equivalent to those of normally hearing subjects but with some notable individual differences. Recently two studies on some cochlear implant subjects indicated modulation transfer functions often quite similar to those of normal hearing but exhibiting marked individual differences in shape and absolute sensitivity. The present study compared amplitude modulation detection and phonetic recognition in a group of cochlear implant subjects to determine the extent to which the two tasks are correlated. Nine individuals who had been implanted with an Ineraid device and who demonstrated open speech understanding ranging from excellent to poor were chosen and tested in the present study. For each subject modulation transfer functions were measured at the most apical electrode and phonetic recognition of isolated vowels and intervocalic consonants was assessed. Results showed a strong correlation between the depth of high-frequency rejection in modulation transfer functions and success in vowel and consonant intelligibility. These results emphasize the importance of temporal speech features and offer perspectives for customizing signal processing in cochlear implants. © 1994, Acoustical Society of America.

	abstract = {The utricle of the inner ear, a vestibular sensory structure that mediates perception of linear acceleration, is comprised of two morphologically and physiologically distinct types of mechanosensory hair cells, referred to as Type Is and Type IIs. While these cell types are easily discriminated in an adult utricle, understanding their development has been hampered by a lack of molecular markers that can be used to identify each cell type prior to maturity. Therefore, we collected single hair cells at three different ages and used single cell RNAseq to characterize the transcriptomes of those cells. Analysis of differential gene expression identified Spp1 as a specific marker for Type I hair cells and Mapt and Anxa4 as specific markers for Type II hair cells. Antibody labeling confirmed the specificity of these markers which were then used to examine the temporal and spatial development of utricular hair cells. While Type I hair cells develop in a gradient that extends across the utricle from posterior-medial to anterior-lateral, Type II hair cells initially develop in the central striolar region and then extend uniformly towards the periphery. Finally, by combining these markers with genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate that over 98\% of all Type I hair cells develop prior to birth while over 98\% of Type II hair cells develop post-natally. These results are consistent with previous findings suggesting that Type I hair cells develop first and refute the hypothesis that Type II hair cells represent a transitional form between immature and Type I hair cells.},

The amplifier is built on a shield that fits over a microcontroller board, an Arduino, which digitizes the signal and sends it to a computer that presents stimuli then records and analyzes the evoked potentials. We used the device to record PERG accurately with a sensitivity as low as half a microvolt. The device has also been designed to implement other evoked potential recordings. This simple device can be quickly constructed and used for experiments in moving systems. Additionally, this device can be used to expose students in underserved areas to research technology that they would otherwise not have access to.},

Materials and methods: After IRB exemption, patient CT scans were anonymized and downloaded as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files to prepare for conversion. These files were converted to stereolithography format for 3D printing. Important soft tissue structures were identified and labeled to be printed in a separate color than bone. Models were printed using a desktop 3D printer (Ultimaker 3 Extended, Ultimaker BV, Netherlands) and polylactic acid (PLA) filament. 10 junior residents with no previous drilling experience participated in the study. Each resident was asked to drill a simple mastoidectomy on both a cadaveric and 3D printed temporal bone. Following their experience, they were asked to complete a Likert questionnaire. Results: The final result was an anatomically accurate (XYZ accuracy = 12.5, 12.5, 5 μm) 3D model of a temporal bone that was deemed to be appropriate in tactile feedback using the surgical drill. The total cost of the material required to fabricate the model was approximately \$1.50. Participants found the 3D models overall to be similar to cadaveric temporal bones, particularly in overall value and safety. Conclusions: 3D printed temporal bone models can be used as an affordable and inexhaustible alternative, or supplement, to traditional cadaveric surgical simulation.},

	abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) are commonly thought to reflect the aggregate dynamics in local neural circuits around recording electrodes. However, we show that when LFPs are recorded in awake behaving animals against a distal reference on the skull as commonly practiced, LFPs are significantly contaminated by non-local and non-neural sources arising from the reference electrode and from movement-related noise. In a data set with simultaneously recorded LFPs and electroencephalograms (EEGs) across multiple brain regions while rats perform an auditory oddball task, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify signals arising from electrical reference and from volume-conducted noise based on their distributed spatial pattern across multiple electrodes and distinct power spectral features. These sources of distal electrical signals collectively accounted for 23-77\% of total variance in unprocessed LFPs, as well as most of the gamma oscillation responses to the target stimulus in EEGs. Gamma oscillation power was concentrated in volume-conducted noise and was tightly coupled with the onset of licking behavior, suggesting a likely origin of muscle activity associated with body movement or orofacial movement. The removal of distal signal contamination also selectively reduced correlations of LFP/EEG signals between distant brain regions but not within the same region. Finally, the removal of contamination from distal electrical signals preserved an event-related potential (ERP) response to auditory stimuli in the frontal cortex and also increased the coupling between the frontal ERP amplitude and neuronal activity in the basal forebrain, supporting the conclusion that removing distal electrical signals unmasked local activity within LFPs. Together, these results highlight the significant contamination of LFPs by distal electrical signals and caution against the straightforward interpretation of unprocessed LFPs. Our results provide a principled approach to identify and remove such contamination to unmask local LFPs.},

Space/time maps of neural activity were constructed from these data, In most of our sample the pattern of response changed systematically as the stimulating frequency was increased in octave steps. At low frequencies ({\textless} 500 Hz) the pattern of response was broadly distributed spatially and phase-locked to the stimulus frequency. At higher frequencies ({\textgreater} 1 kHz) the pattern of response was more localized and showed no evidence of phase locking. The location of the maximum response to tones from 1 to 32 kHz moved ventrally along the tonotopic axis at an approximate rate of 230 μm/stimulus octave. The patterns Of response were localized near stimulus threshold and spread over a larger region as level increased. This method of collecting and displaying multiunit response maps provides an overview of ensemble activity that allows concurrent observation of spatial and temporal variations in activity patterns. The quantitative analysis of components of MU-PST Maps are consistent with trends illustrated with single-unit tuning and level functions. This perspective of IC activity suggests potential processing mechanisms that are congruent with single-unit reconstructions.},

The recording tracks were reconstructed anatomically. From the field potentials the one-dimensional current source density (CSD) distributions were calculated. 2. 2. By comparing the CSD profiles with the anatomical features of the reconstructed recording paths, the components of the CSDs could be attributed to certain anatomical sites. Thus a physiological method for the functional identification of recording sites was obtained. It permits the identification of depth locations of specific laminae in cortex. In the inferior colliculus it permits distinction between central and peripheral regions and between three depth segments. 3. 3. The CSDs in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus lend functional support to the anatomical division into three distinct parts and, in addition, provide the temporal aspects of the main groups of synaptic activities. 4. 4.

	abstract = {In auditory research, hearing function of mouse mutants is assessed in vivo by evoked potential recording. Evaluation of the response parameters should be performed with reference to the evoked responses recorded from wild-type mice. This study reports normative data calculated on auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) obtained from 20 wild-type C57 BL/6J mice at a postnatal age between 21 and 45 days. Acoustic stimuli consisted tone bursts at 8, 14, 20, 26, 32 kHz, and clicks. Each stimulus was delivered in free field at stimulation intensity starting from a maximum of 100 dB peak equivalent SPL (dB peSPL) at decreasing steps of 10 dB with a repetition rate of 13/sec. Evoked responses were recorded by needle electrodes inserted subcutaneously. At high intensity stimulation, five response waveforms, each consisting of a positive peak and a subsequent negative valley, were identified within 7 msec, and were labelled with sequential capital Roman numerals from I to V. Peak IV was the most robust and stable at low intensities for both tone burst and click stimuli, and was therefore utilized to estimate hearing thresholds. Both latencies and amplitudes of ABR peaks showed good reproducibility with acceptable standard deviations. Mean wave IV thresholds measured across all animals ranged from a maximum of 23 dB peSPL for clicks to a minimum of 7 dB peSPL for 20 kHz-tone burst stimuli. Statistical analysis of the distribution of latencies and amplitudes of peaks from I to V performed for each stimulus type yielded a normative data set which was utilised to obtain the most consistent fitting-curve model. This could serve as a reference for further studies on murine models of hearing loss.},

We found that hair cells were completely destroyed and spiral ganglion neurons were severely damaged in the basal cochleae of amikacin-treated animals. Hair cells as well as spiral ganglion neurons were damaged also in the middle and apical areas of the cochlea, with the damage being greater in the middle than the apical area. Amplitudes of local-field potentials were reduced in the ventromedial inferior colliculus, but enhanced in the dorsolateral inferior colliculus. Latencies of responses were increased over the entire structure. The enhancement of responses in the dorsolateral inferior colliculus was in contrast with the damage of hair cells and spiral ganglion cells in the apical part of the cochlea. This contrast along with the overall increase of latencies suggests that early cochlear damage can alter neural mechanisms within the inferior colliculus and/or the inputs to this midbrain structure.},

These deficits likely result from impairments in auditory neural synchrony; such dyssynchrony of the neural responses has been linked to demyelination of auditory nerve fibers. However, no appropriate animal models are currently available that mimic this pathology. In this study, Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR +/+ ) mice were cross-mated with mice containing Cre (Bhlhb5-Cre +/- ) specific to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In double-positive offspring mice, the injection of diphtheria toxin (DT) led to a 30-40\% rate of death for SGNs, but no hair cell damage. Demyelination types of pathologies were observed around the surviving SGNs and their fibers, many of which were distorted in shape. Correspondingly, a significant reduction in response synchrony to amplitude modulation was observed in this group of animals compared to the controls, which had a Cre- genotype. Taken together, our results suggest that SGN damage following the injection of DT in mice with Bhlhb5-Cre +/- and iDTR +/- is likely to be a good AN model of demyelination.},

	abstract = {Objective The auditory brain stem implant (ABI) is a neuroprosthesis placed on the surface of the cochlear nucleus (CN) to provide hearing sensations in children and adults who are not candidates for cochlear implantation. Contemporary ABI arrays are stiff and do not conform to the curved brain stem surface. Recent advancements in microfabrication techniques have enabled the development of flexible surface arrays, but these have only been applied in animal models. Herein, we measure the surface curvature of the human CN and adjoining regions to assist in the design and placement of next-generation conformable clinical ABI arrays. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions from ultrahigh T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences and histologic reconstructions based on postmortem adult human brain stem specimens were used. Design This is a retrospective review of radiologic data and postmortem histologic axial sections. Setting This is set at the tertiary referral center. Participants Data were acquired from healthy adults. Main Outcome Measures The main outcome measures are principal curvature values (Kmin and Kmax) and global radius of curvature. Results The CN was successfully extracted and rendered as a 3D surface in all cases. Significant curvatures of the CN in both histologic and radiographic reconstructions were found with global radius of curvature ranging from 2.08 to 8.5 mm. In addition, local curvature analysis revealed that the surface is highly complex. Conclusion Detailed rendering of the human CN is feasible using histology and 3D MRI reconstruction and highlights complex surface topography that is not recapitulated by contemporary stiff ABI arrays.},

	abstract = {Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) implements a variety of sound processing algorithms that seek to improve speech intelligibility. Typically, only a small number of parameter combinations are evaluated with recipients but the optimal configuration may differ for individuals. The present study evaluates a novel methodology which uses the output signal to noise ratio (OSNR) to predict complete psychometric functions that relate speech recognition to signal to noise ratio for individual CI recipients. Design: Speech scores from sentence-in-noise tests in a "reference" condition were mapped to OSNR and a psychometric function was fitted. The reference variability was defined as the root mean square error between the reference scores and the fitted curve. To predict individual scores in a different condition, OSNRs in that condition were calculated and the corresponding scores were read from the reference psychometric function. In a retrospective experiment, scores were predicted for each condition and subject in three existing data sets of sentence scores. The prediction error was defined as the root mean square error between observed and predicted scores. In data set 1, sentences were mixed with 20 talker babble or speech weighted noise and presented at 65 dB sound pressure level (SPL). An adaptive test procedure was used. Sound processing was advanced combinatorial encoding (ACE, Cochlear Limited) and ACE with ideal binary mask processing, with five different threshold settings. In data set 2, sentences were mixed with speech weighted noise, street-side city noise or cocktail party noise and presented at 65 dB SPL. An adaptive test procedure was used. Sound processing was ACE and ACE with two different noise reduction schemes. In data set 3, sentences were mixed with four-talker babble at two input SNRs and presented at levels of 55-89 dB SPL. Sound processing utilised three different automatic gain control configurations. Results: For data set 1, the median of individual prediction errors across all subjects, noise types and conditions, was 12\% points, slightly better than the reference variability. The OSNR prediction method was inaccurate for the specific condition with a gain threshold of +10 dB. For data set 2, the median of individual prediction errors was 17\% points and the reference variability was 11\% points. For data set 3, the median prediction error was 9\% points and the reference variability was 7\% points. A Monte Carlo simulation found that the OSNR prediction method, which used reference scores and OSNR to predict individual scores in other conditions, was significantly more accurate (p {\textless} 0.01) than simply using reference scores as predictors. Conclusions: The results supported the hypothesis that the OSNR prediction method could accurately predict individual recipient scores for a range of algorithms and noise types, for all but one condition. The medians of the individual prediction errors for each data set were accurate within 6\% points of the reference variability and compared favourably with prediction methodologies in other recent studies. Overall, the novel OSNR-based prediction method shows promise as a tool to assist researchers and clinicians in the development or fitting of CI sound processors.},

The primary outcome was complications related to MRI scanning in implant recipients, including failure to complete MRI sessions. The secondary outcome was magnet void size due to MRI scanning with magnet in situ.Results:Ninety-seven patients (21 ABI recipients, 76 CI recipients of whom 23 were bilateral) underwent a total of 428 MRI sessions consisting of 680 MRI procedures, which generated 2,601 MRI sequences (excluding localizers). Of these, 28/428 (6.5\%) MRI sessions were performed with magnet removed, and the remaining 400/428 (93.4\%) with the magnet in situ. The overall complication rate per session was 15/428 (3.5\%). The majority of complications were accounted for by patient discomfort, in some cases requiring abandoning the scan session, but 5 magnet dislocations were also recorded. There were no cases of implant device failure or excessive demagnetization of the receiver stimulator magnet.For CI and ABI recipients, the implant caused large voids of around 110 mm × 60 mm with the magnet in situ which reduced to 60 mm × 30 mm when the magnet was removed. However, it was usually possible to visualize the internal acoustic meatus and cerebellopontine angle by positioning the implant package higher and further forward compared with conventional positioning.Conclusion:MRI scanning in ABI and CI recipients is generally safe and well tolerated without magnet removal, and carries a low rate of complications. However, patients should be fully informed of the possibility of discomfort, and precautions such as local anesthetic injection and head bandaging may reduce the likelihood of adverse events.},

	abstract = {This review, one of a series of articles, tries to make sense of optogenetics, a recently developed technology that can be used to control the activity of genetically-defined neurons with light. Cells are first genetically engineered to express a lightsensitive opsin, which is typically an ion channel, pump, or G protein-coupled receptor. When engineered cells are then illuminated with light of the correct frequency, opsin-bound retinal undergoes a conformational change that leads to channel opening or pump activation, cell depolarization or hyperpolarization, and neural activation or silencing. Since the advent of optogenetics, many different opsin variants have been discovered or engineered, and it is now possible to stimulate or inhibit neuronal activity or intracellular signaling pathways on fast or slow timescales with a variety of different wavelengths of light. Optogenetics has been successfully employed to enhance our understanding of the neural circuit dysfunction underlying mood disorders, addiction, and Parkinson's disease, and has enabled us to achieve a better understanding of the neural circuits mediating normal behavior. It has revolutionized the field of neuroscience, and has enabled a new generation of experiments that probe the causal roles of specific neural circuit components.},

We apply an open-source computational drug repositioning platform to gene expression data from 80 patient tumors and identify eight promising FDA-approved drugs with potential for repurposing in VS. Of these eight, mifepristone, a progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, consistently and adversely affects the morphology, metabolic activity, and proliferation of primary human VS cells and HEI-193 human schwannoma cells. Mifepristone treatment reduces VS cell viability more significantly than cells derived from patient meningiomas, while healthy human Schwann cells remain unaffected.

	abstract = {1. The assumption that the negative extracellular population spikes recorded from the pyramidal or granular layers in the hippocampal formation in response to appropriate afferent volleys is due to the sum of individual unitary discharges was tested by recording unit activity and population spike with microelectrodes, using normal and ultrashort amplifier time constants. 2. Unit spikes were correlated in time with the population spike. 3. The size of the population spike was altered by varying the stimulus strength, or by using a conditioning-test technique. In either case the number of units recorded followed the change in the size of the population spike. For very large population spikes, the technique failed since unit spikes could then no longer be clearly distinguished. 4. The theoretically expected shape of the population spike as a summation of individual unit discharges was derived, and discussed in terms of the observed results. 5. We conclude that over a wide range the height of the population spike is an increasing function of the number of discharging cells and can thus be used as a measure of the extent to which an afferent volley discharges a cell population. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) is among the most important experimental measures when probing neural population activity, but a proper understanding of the link between the underlying neural activity and the LFP signal is still missing. Here we investigate this link by mathematical modeling of contributions to the LFP from a single layer-5 pyramidal neuron and a single layer-4 stellate neuron receiving synaptic input. An intrinsic dendritic low-pass filtering effect of the LFP signal, previously demonstrated for extracellular signatures of action potentials, is seen to strongly affect the LFP power spectra, even for frequencies as low as 10 Hz for the example pyramidal neuron. Further, the LFP signal is found to depend sensitively on both the recording position and the position of the synaptic input: the LFP power spectra recorded close to the active synapse are typically found to be less low-pass filtered than spectra recorded further away. Some recording positions display striking band-pass characteristics of the LFP. The frequency dependence of the properties of the current dipole moment set up by the synaptic input current is found to qualitatively account for several salient features of the observed LFP. Two approximate schemes for calculating the LFP, the dipole approximation and the two-monopole approximation, are tested and found to be potentially useful for translating results from large-scale neural network models into predictions for results from electroencephalographic (EEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

	abstract = {The intracerebral local field potential (LFP) is a measure of brain activity that reflects the highly dynamic flow of information across neural networks. This is a composite signal that receives contributions from multiple neural sources, yet interpreting its nature and significance may be hindered by several confounding factors and technical limitations. By and large, the main factor defining the amplitude of LFPs is the geometry of the current sources, over and above the degree of synchronization or the properties of the media. As such, similar levels of activity may result in potentials that differ in several orders of magnitude in different populations. The geometry of these sources has been experimentally inaccessible until intracerebral high density recordings enabled the co-activating sources to be revealed. Without this information, it has proven difficult to interpret a century’s worth of recordings that used temporal cues alone, such as event or spike related potentials and frequency bands. Meanwhile, a collection of biophysically ill-founded concepts have been considered legitimate, which can now be corrected in the light of recent advances. The relationship of LFPs to their sources is often counterintuitive. For instance, most LFP activity is not local but remote, it may be larger further from rather than close to the source, the polarity does not define its excitatory or inhibitory nature, and the amplitude may increase when source’s activity is reduced. As technological developments foster the use of LFPs, the time is now ripe to raise awareness of the need to take into account spatial aspects of these signals and of the errors derived from neglecting to do so.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings provide objective estimates of listeners' cortical processing of sounds and of the status of their speech perception system. For profoundly deaf listeners with cochlear implants (CIs), the applications of EEG are limited because the device adds electric artifacts to the recordings. This restricts the possibilities for the neural-based metrics of speech processing by CI users, for instance to gauge cortical reorganization due to individual's hearing loss history. This paper describes the characteristics of the CI artifact as recorded with an artificial head substitute, and reports how the artifact is affected by the properties of the acoustical input signal versus the settings of the device. Methods: We created a brain substitute using agar that simulates the brain's conductivity, placed it in a human skull, and performed EEG recordings with CIs from three different manufacturers. As stimuli, we used simple and complex non-speech stimuli, as well as naturally produced continuous speech. We examined the effect of manipulating device settings in both controlled experimental CI configurations and real clinical maps. Results: An increase in the magnitude of the stimulation current through the device settings increases also the magnitude of the artifact. The artifact recorded to speech is smaller in magnitude than for non-speech stimuli due to signal-inherent amplitude modulations. Conclusion: The CI EEG artifact for speech appears more difficult to detect than for simple stimuli. Since the artifact differs across CI users, due to their individual clinical maps, the method presented enables insight into the individual manifestations of the artifact.},

	abstract = {The cochlear implant (CI) is the first effective treatment for deafness and severe losses in hearing. As such, the CI is now widely regarded as one of the great advances in modern medicine. This article reviews the key events and discoveries that led up to the current CI systems, and we review and present some among the many possibilities for further improvements in device design and performance. The past achievements include: (1) development of reliable devices that can be used over the lifetime of a patient; (2) development of arrays of implanted electrodes that can stimulate more than one site in the cochlea; and (3) progressive and large improvements in sound processing strategies for CIs. In addition, cooperation between research organizations and companies greatly accelerated the widespread availability and use of safe and effective devices. Possibilities for the future include: (1) use of otoprotective drugs; (2) further improvements in electrode designs and placements; (3) further improvements in sound processing strategies; (4) use of stem cells to replace lost sensory hair cells and neural structures in the cochlea; (5) gene therapy; (6) further reductions in the trauma caused by insertions of electrodes and other manipulations during implant surgeries; and (7) optical rather electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Each of these possibilities is the subject of active research. Although great progress has been made to date in the development of the CI, including the first substantial restoration of a human sense, much more progress seems likely and certainly would not be a surprise. Anat Rec, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The cochlear implant (CI) has transformed the field of otology. Just 50 years ago, there were no effective treatments for deafness and severe losses in hearing. The development of the CI changed that completely and today most recipients of CIs can converse with ease using their cell phones. The development has been both rapid and remarkable (Fraysse et al., 2006, Gantz et al., 2005, Gstoettner et al., 2008, Balkany et al., 2006 and Eshraghi et al., 2009). In most cases, deafness and severe losses in hearing are caused by damage to or destruction of the sensory hair cells in the cochlea. The function of the CI is to bypass those damaged or missing structures by exciting neurons in the auditory nerve directly with electrical stimuli. Modern CIs selectively excite subpopulations of neurons using different electrodes in an array of electrodes inserted at surgery into the scala tympani of the cochlea. The bioengineering and surgical principles underlying successful CIs are explained in detail in a companion paper in this special issue (Eshraghi et al., 2012). The purposes of the present article are to (1) provide an overview of the efforts leading up to the current devices, and (2) describe some among the many possibilities for further improvements in design and performance. Remaining problems that might be addressed or at least ameliorated include a persistent variability in outcomes even with the newest CI systems; difficulties experienced by most patients in listening to speech in noisy environments or in competition with other talkers; and reception of sounds more complex than western speech such as music and tone languages. Any further improvements would of course build upon the already impressive performances achieved to date.},

Although originally confined to electrophoresis work, agarose gels have proven themselves useful to a number of disciplines in the modern world, which includes brain infusion studies for research involving the treatment of various neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease. In reviewing the relevant research leading up to the modern day, this paper attempts to track agarose gels through their stages of accuracy verification, highlighting why they are useful to the neurosurgery discipline and characterizing the nature of their use. Agarose gels do have significant limitations, which are also discussed, but they have substantial potential as a modifiable medium or as a basis of comparison for even more accurate models in the future.},

	abstract = {Background: The electrical properties of Agarose gel, namely impedance and capacitance, are relatively unexplored. Agarose gels are used as in vitro models in studies across numerous disciplines, including imaging, radiotherapy, infusion, and neurosurgery. Purpose: In this study, we seek to characterize the impedance response of low concentration agarose gels by relating the gel concentrations to Nyquist Plot phase in order to establish a baseline with which to modify the response of the gel to simulate that of in vivo brain tissue. This information is relevant to areas such as deep brain stimulation, and could have a significant impact on in vitro model design for such studies in the future. Methods: Te n agarose gels spanning four different concentrations were subjected to impedance spectroscopy using a Model 3387 DBS electrode. Phase angles were calculated and Cartesian Nyquist plots generated from the data. Results: Results suggest that an inverse relationship exists between agarose gel concentration and phase angle. In addition, the results indicate that agarose gel reasonably emulates a constant phase element, which portrays the electrode-electrolyte interface impedance of some equivalent circuit models of brain tissue. Conclusion: The data shows that agarose gel is a suitable substrate for a deep brain stimulation in vitro model, but requires modification. In the future, we plan to utilize this data to determine the modifications necessary in the current agarose gel model to make it scientifically applicable to studies of both deep brain stimulation and infusion due to their overlapping variables.},

	abstract = {The cochlea encodes sounds through frequency-selective channels that exhibit low-pass modulation sensitivity. Unlike the cochlea, neurons in the auditory midbrain are tuned for spectral and temporal modulations found in natural sounds, yet the role of this transformation is not known. We report a distinct tradeoff in modulation sensitivity and tuning that is topographically ordered within the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC). Spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) were obtained with 16-channel electrodes inserted orthogonal to the isofrequency lamina. Surprisingly, temporal and spectral characteristics exhibited an opposing relationship along the tonotopic axis. For low best frequencies (BFs), units were selective for fast temporal and broad spectral modulations. A systematic progression was observed toward slower temporal and finer spectral modulation sensitivity at high BF. This tradeoff was strongly reflected in the arrangement of excitation and inhibition and, consequently, in the modulation tuning characteristics. Comparisons with auditory nerve fibers show that these trends oppose the pattern imposed by the peripheral filters. These results suggest that spectrotemporal preferences are reordered within the tonotopic axis of the CNIC. This topographic organization has profound implications for the coding of spectrotemporal features in natural sounds and could underlie a number of perceptual phenomena.},

	abstract = {Electrical stimulation of the auditory periphery organ by cochlear implant (CI) generates highly synchronized inputs to the auditory system. It has long been thought such inputs would lead to highly synchronized neural firing along the ascending auditory pathway. However, neurophysiological studies with hearing animals have shown that the central auditory system progressively converts temporal representations of time-varying sounds to firing rate-based representations. It is not clear whether this coding principle also applies to highly synchronized CI inputs. Higher-frequency modulations in CI stimulation have been found to evoke largely transient responses with little sustained firing in previous studies of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in anesthetized animals. Here, we show that, in addition to neurons displaying synchronized firing to CI stimuli, a large population of A1 neurons in awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) responded to rapid time-varying CI stimulation with discharges that were not synchronized to CI stimuli, yet reflected changing repetition frequency by increased firing rate. Marmosets of both sexes were included in this study. By comparing directly each neuron’s responses to time-varying acoustic and CI signals, we found that individual A1 neurons encode both modalities with similar firing patterns (stimulus-synchronized or nonsynchronized). These findings suggest that A1 neurons use the same basic coding schemes to represent time-varying acoustic or CI stimulation and provide new insights into mechanisms underlying how the brain processes natural sounds via a CI device.},

Fifty-eight children were fitted with the Cochlear 24 ABI device and 6 with the MedEl ABI device, and all children followed the same rehabilitation program. Auditory perceptual abilities were evaluated on the Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scale. No child was lost to follow-up, and there were no exclusions from the study. All children showed significant improvement in auditory perception with implant experience. Seven children (11\%) were able to achieve the highest score on the CAP test; they were able to converse on the telephone within 3 years of implantation. Twenty children (31.3\%) achieved open set speech recognition (CAP score of 5 or greater) and 30 (46.9\%) achieved a CAP level of 4 or greater. Of the 29 children without nonauditory disabilities, 18 (62\%) achieved a CAP score of 5 or greater with the ABI. All children showed continued improvements in auditory skills over time.

In many mammalian species, pup calls became more significant for mothers than other conspecific and heterospecific communication sounds. To study the cortical consequences of motherhood on the processing of communication sounds, we recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of virgin and mother C57BL/6 mice which had similar ABR thresholds. In mothers, the evoked firing rate in response to pure tones was decreased and the frequency receptive fields were narrower. The responses to pup and adult calls were also reduced but the amount of mutual information (MI) per spike about the pup call's identity was increased in mother mice. The response latency to pup and adult calls was significantly shorter in mothers. Despite similarly decreased responses to guinea pig whistles, the response latency, and the MI per spike did not differ between virgins and mothers for these heterospecific vocalizations. Noise correlations between cortical recordings were decreased in mothers, suggesting that the firing rate of distant neurons was more independent from each other. Together, these results indicate that in the most commonly used mouse strain for behavioral studies, the discrimination of pup calls by auditory cortex neurons is more efficient during motherhood.},

	abstract = {This study has shown that electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve in the cat at a certain rate will not reproduce the same firing patterns in the cells of the superior olivary complex as a tone of the same frequency. This occurred because the electrical stimulus probably produced synchronous firing of all the auditory nerve fibers, and the inhibitory mechanisms of the cochlear nucleus prevented activation of the auditory cells for all stimulus rates greater than 200/sec. On the other hand, a few cells were recorded in the medial superior olive which gave on- and off-responses to a tone and this firing pattern was reproduced with an electrical stimulus. Although electrical stimulation could not cause sustained excitation of cells, inhibition of spontaneous activity occurred for the duration of the stimulus in a number of cases. This was considered to be due to the effect of efferent stimulation of the olivocochlear bundle on spontaneous activity arising from the cochlea. Bipolar electrical stimulation of the cochlea was also carried out and this excited some cells in the superior olivary complex with characteristic frequencies in the middle to high frequency range. It was not possible to be certain, however, whether this was due to electromechanical stimulation or direct excitation of auditory nerve endings. © 1969.},

To demonstrate Slide-seq’s utility, we localized cell types identified by large-scale scRNA-seq datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus. We next systematically characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, identifying new axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments.

The ECAP measurement paradigm "Alternating Polarity" was utilized to record responses via the implanted ABI electrode array placed on the cochlear nucleus. Emphasizing on the different location of stimulation and recording, these responses are called local evoked potentials (LEP). LEP measurements were conducted during the clinical routine in 16 ABI patients (12 children and 4 adults), corresponding to 191 electrode contacts. A retrospective analysis of these data revealed, that LEP responses were observed in 64.9\% of all measured electrode contacts. LEP responses predicted auditory perception with a sensitivity of 90.5\%. False-positive rate was 33.7\%. Objective LEP thresholds were highly significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) correlated both to behavioral thresholds (Pearson's r = 0.697) and behavioral most comfortable levels (r = 0.840).

Although central auditory neurons that selectively respond to the direction of frequency modulation are known, the synaptic mechanisms underlying the generation of direction selectivity (DS) remain elusive. Here we show the emergence of DS neurons in the inferior colliculus by mapping the three major subcortical auditory nuclei. Cell-attached recordings reveal a highly reliable and precise firing of DS neurons to FM sweeps in a preferred direction. By using in vivo whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings, we found that the synaptic inputs to DS neurons are not direction selective, but temporally reversed excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are evoked in response to opposing directions of FM sweeps. The construction of such temporal asymmetry, resulting DS, and its topography can be attributed to the spectral disparity of the excitatory and the inhibitory synaptic tonal receptive fields. Many auditory neurons are selective to the direction of frequency-modulated sounds in human speech and animal vocalization. Kuo and Wu find that the spectral disparity of the excitatory and the inhibitory synaptic receptive fields results in generating such direction selectivity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) was originally developed to provide rehabilitation of retrocochlear deafness caused by neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Recent studies of the ABI have investigated outcomes in non-NF2 cohorts, such as patients with cochlear nerve aplasia or cochlear ossification and more recently, intractable tinnitus. New technologies that improve the ABI-neural tissue interface are being explored as means to improve performance and decrease side effects. Innovative discoveries in optogenetics and bioengineering present opportunities to continually evolve this technology into the future, enhancing spatial selectivity of neuronal activation in the cochlear nucleus and preventing side effects through reduction in activation of non-target neuronal circuitry. These advances will improve surgical planning and ultimately improve patients’ audiological capabilities. ABI research has rapidly increased in the 21st century and applications of this technology are likely to continually evolve. Herein, we aim to characterize ongoing clinical, basic science, and bioengineering advances in ABIs and discuss future directions of this technology.},

	abstract = {Understanding how communication sounds are processed and encoded in the central auditory system is critical to understanding the neural bases of acoustic communication. Here, we examined neuronal representations of species-specific vocalizations, which are communication sounds that many species rely on for survival and social interaction. In some species, the evoked responses of auditory cortex neurons are stronger in response to natural conspecific vocalizations than to their time-reversed, spectrally identical, counterparts. We applied information theory-based analyses to single-unit spike trains collected in the auditory cortex (n = 139) and auditory thalamus (n = 135) of anesthetized animals as well as in the auditory cortex (n = 119) of awake guinea pigs during presentation of four conspecific vocalizations. Few thalamic and cortical cells ({\textless}10\%) displayed a firing rate preference for the natural version of these vocalizations. In contrast, when the information transmitted by the spike trains was quantified with a temporal precision of 10-50 ms, many cells ({\textgreater}75\%) displayed a significant amount of information (i.e., {\textgreater}2SD above chance levels), especially in the awake condition. The computed correlation index between spike trains (Rcorr, defined by Schreiber et al., 2003) indicated similar spike-timing reliability for both the natural and time-reversed versions of each vocalization, but higher reliability for awake animals compared with anesthetized animals. Based on temporal discharge patterns, even cells that were only weakly responsive to vocalizations displayed a significant level of information. These findings emphasize the importance of temporal discharge patterns as a coding mechanism for natural communication sounds, particularly in awake animals.

Optogenetic proteins are widely used to control neuronal activity, while genetically encoded fluorescent reporters are used to monitor activity.

Here, we describe how silk fibroin films simplify optogenetic experiments by providing targeted delivery of viruses. Films composed of silk fibroin and virus are applied to the surface of implantable optical components. After surgery, silk releases the virus to transduce nearby cells and provide localized expression around optical fibers and endoscopes. Silk films can also be used to express genetically encoded sensors in large cortical regions by using cranial windows coated with a silk/virus mixture. The ease of use and improved performance provided by silk make this a promising approach for optogenetic studies.},

Here, we compare the structure, function, and development of each auditory cortex (ACx) in the mouse to look for specializations that may underlie lateralization. Using Fos brain volume imaging, we found greater activation in the left ACx in response to vocalizations, while the right ACx responded more to frequency sweeps. In vivo recordings identified hemispheric differences in spectrotemporal selectivity, reinforcing their functional differences. We then compared the synaptic connectivity within each hemisphere and discovered lateralized circuit-motifs that are hearing experience-dependent. Our results suggest a specialist role for the left ACx, focused on facilitating the detection of specific vocalization features, while the right ACx is a generalist with the ability to integrate spectrotemporal features more broadly.},

Therefore, developing efficacious pharmacological agents that can traverse the BBB is crucial for optimal treatment of diseases of the CNS such as neurodegenerative conditions and brain tumors. Adeno-associated virus (AAV), one of the most promising gene therapy vectors, has been shown to cross the BBB safely and is non-pathogenic in nature and therefore has been utilized for numerous diseases of the CNS. Along with the development of protein engineering techniques such as directed evolution including DNA shuffling, a great number of BBB-crossing AAVs have been developed, that could be systemically injected for therapeutic benefit. In this review, we discuss several feasible approaches to improve transportation of therapeutic agents to the CNS. We also discuss the advantages of using BBB-crossing AAVs, their role as a gene delivery agent and highlight the different types of BBB-AAV vectors that have been developed in order to provide a greater insight into how they can be used in diseases of the CNS.},

	doi = {10.1080/03655230600895309},
	abstract = {Evidence has accumulated in the last decade that the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) may be an important site in the etiology of tinnitus. This evidence comes from a combination of studies conducted in animals and humans. This paper will review the key findings, as follows. 1) Direct electrical stimulation of the DCN leads to changes in the loudness of tinnitus. This suggests that the loudness of tinnitus may be linked to changes in the level of neural activity in the DCN. 2) Exposure to tinnitus inducers, such as intense sound or cisplatin, causes neural activity in the DCN to become chronically elevated, a condition known as neuronal hyperactivity. 3) This hyperactivity is very similar to the activity that is evoked in the DCN by sound stimulation, suggesting that the hyperactivity represents a code that signals the presence of sound, even when there is no longer any sound stimulus. 4) Noise-induced hyperactivity in the DCN is correlated with tinnitus. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that animals exposed to the same intense sound that causes hyperactivity in the DCN develop tinnitus-like percepts. The correlation between the level of hyperactivity and the behavioral index of tinnitus was found to be statistically significant. 5) The DCN is a polysensory integration center, and electrophysiological studies have shown that both spontaneous activity and hyperactivity of neurons in the DCN can be modulated by stimulation of certain ipsilateral cranial nerves, such as the sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve. This ipsilateral modulation of DCN activity offers a plausible explanation of how tinnitus, when perceived on one side, can be modulated by certain manipulations of the head and neck on the side ipsilateral to the tinnitus, but rarely on the contralateral side. 6) The DCN exhibits various forms of neuronal plasticity that parallel the various forms of plasticity that characterize tinnitus. These findings collectively strengthen the view that the DCN may be a key structure that should be included as a target of anti-tinnitus treatment. © 2006 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {Neural prostheses that stimulate the neocortex have the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders. However, the efficacy of electrode-based implants remains limited, with persistent challenges that include an inability to create precise patterns of neural activity as well as difficulties in maintaining response consistency over time. These problems arise from fundamental limitations of electrodes as well as their susceptibility to implantation and have proven difficult to overcome. Magnetic stimulation can address many of these limitations, but coils small enough to be implanted into the cortex were not thought strong enough to activate neurons. We describe a new microcoil design and demonstrate its effectiveness for both activating cortical neurons and driving behavioral responses. The stimulation of cortical pyramidal neurons in brain slices in vitro was reliable and could be confined to spatially narrow regions ({\textless}60 mm). The spatially asymmetric fields arising from the coil helped to avoid the simultaneous activation of passing axons. In vivo implantation was safe and resulted in consistent and predictable behavioral responses. The high permeability of magnetic fields to biological substances may yield another important advantage because it suggests that encapsulation and other adverse effects of implantation will not diminish coil performance over time, as happens to electrodes. These findings suggest that a coil-based implant might be a useful alternative to existing electrode-based devices. The enhanced selectivity of microcoil-based magnetic stimulation will be especially useful for visual prostheses as well as for many brain-computer interface applications that require precise activation of the cortex.},

	abstract = {We recorded single-unit and multi-unit activity in response to transient presentation of texture and grating patterns at 25 sites within the parafoveal representation of V1, V2, and V3 of two awake monkeys trained to perform a fixation task. In grating experiments, stimuli varied in orientation, spatial frequency, or both. In texture experiments, stimuli varied in contrast, check size, texture type, or pairs of these attributes. 2. To examine the nature and precision of temporal coding, we compared individual responses elicited by each set of stimuli in terms of two families of metrics. One family of metrics, D(spike), was sensitive to the absolute spike time (following stimulus onset). The second family of metrics, D(interval), was sensitive to the pattern of interspike intervals. In each family, the metrics depend on the parameter q, which expresses the precision of temporal coding. For q = 0, both metrics collapse into the 'spike count' metric (D(count)), which is sensitive to the number of impulses but insensitive to their position in time. 3. Each of these metrics, with values of q ranging from 0 to 512/s, was used to calculate the distance between all pairs of spike trains within each dataset. The extent of stimulus-specific clustering manifest in these pairwise distances was quantified by an information measure. Chance clustering was estimated by applying the same procedure to synthetic data sets in which responses were assigned randomly to the input stimuli. 4. Of the 352 data sets, 170 showed evidence of tuning via the spike count (q = 0) metric, 294 showed evidence of tuning via the spike time metric, 272 showed evidence of tuning via the spike interval metric to the stimulus attribute (contrast, check size, orientation, spatial frequency, or texture type) under study. Across the entire dataset, the information not attributable to chance clustering averaged 0.042 bits for the spike count metric 0.171 bits for the optimal spike time metric, and 0.107 bits for the optimal spike interval metric. 5. The reciprocal of the optimal cost q serves as a measure of the temporal precision of temporal coding. In V1 and V2, with both metrics, temporal precision was highest for contrast (ca. 10-30 ms) and lowest for texture type (ca. 100 ms). This systematic dependence of q on stimulus attribute provides a possible mechanism for the simultaneous representation of multiple stimulus attributes in one spike train. 6. Our findings are inconsistent with Poisson models of spike trains. Synthetic data sets in which firing rate was governed by a time-dependent. Poisson process matched to the observed poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) overestimated clustering induced by D(count) and, for low values of q, D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q]. Synthetic data sets constructed from a modified Poisson process, which preserved not only the PSTH but also spike count statistics accounted for the clustering induced by D(count) but underestimated the clustering induced by D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q].},

Based on this analysis, we generated a detailed map of the human brainstem. To assess the validity of our maps, we compared our observations with histological maps of traditional human brainstem atlases. Given the unique capability of MRI-based morphometric analysis in generating and preserving the morphology of 3D objects from individual 2D sections, we reconstructed the motor, sensory and integrative neural systems of the brainstem and rendered them in 3D representations. We anticipate the utilization of these maps by the neuroimaging community for applications in basic neuroscience as well as in neurology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery, due to their versatile computational nature in 2D and 3D representations in a publicly available capacity.},

	abstract = {In multichannel cochlear implants (CIs), current is delivered to specific electrodes along the cochlea in the form of amplitude-modulated pulse trains, to convey temporal and spectral cues. Our previous studies have shown that focused multipolar (FMP) and tripolar (TP) stimulation produce more restricted neural activation and reduced channel interactions in the inferior colliculus (IC) compared with traditional monopolar (MP) stimulation, suggesting that focusing of stimulation could produce better transmission of spectral information. The present study explored the capability of IC neurons to detect modulated CI stimulation with FMP and TP stimulation compared with MP stimulation. The study examined multiunit responses of IC neurons in acutely deafened guinea pigs by systematically varying the stimulation configuration, modulation depth, and stimulation level. Stimuli were sinusoidal amplitude-modulated pulse trains (carrier rate of 120 pulses/s). Modulation sensitivity was quantified by measuring modulation detection thresholds (MDTs), defined as the lowest modulation depth required to differentiate the response of a modulated stimulus from an unmodulated one. Whereas MP stimulation showed significantly lower MDTs than FMP and TP stimulation (P values {\textless}0.05) at stimulation ≤2 dB above threshold, all stimulation configurations were found to have similar modulation sensitivities at 4 dB above threshold. There was no difference found in modulation sensitivity between FMP and TP stimulation. The present study demonstrates that current focusing techniques such as FMP and TP can adequately convey amplitude modulation and are comparable to MP stimulation, especially at higher stimulation levels, although there may be some trade-off between spectral and temporal fidelity with current focusing stimulation.},

	abstract = {In response to 100-ms duration electrical stimulation within the range 50-400 pulses per second (pps), and at 1.6- to 2.4-mA stimulus current, a range of poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) patterns were observed from dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) units, they were usually primarylike, onset or “negative response” and occasionally buildup or pauser patterns. It appeared that the excitatory and suppressive processes, also termed neural drives, in response to 2.5-pps electrical stimulation were the main determinants of DCN unit responses to 50- to 400-pps stimulation. This was demonstrated by a model of DCN responses to electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. The neural drives required to model the PSTH patterns were (i) an excitatory process with a latency of {\textless}5 ms, (ii) a second excitatory process latency of 4.5-10 ms, (iii) a long acting suppressive process with a latency of {\textless}15 ms and a duration of {\textgreater}70 ms, (iv) a short acting suppressive response with a latency of 2.5-3.7 ms and a duration usually {\textless}5 ms, but always {\textless}20, and (v) a drive contributing spontaneous activity to the unit. In addition to these processes which were observed at 2.5 pps, an additional, transient suppressive process was postulated to operate only at 50-400 pps. It was postulated that the PSTH patterns observed were due to differences in the strengths of these drives between units. © 1995, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},

Discharge properties of CN cells and AN axons were tested in response to 50-ms trains of electrical pulses delivered to the AN at rates ranging from 100 to 1000 pulses per second (pps). At low stimulation rates (200-300 pps), the discharges of AN fibers and a large proportion of principal cells (bushy, octopus, stellate) in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) followed with high probability each pulse in the train, resulting in synchronization of discharges within large populations of AN fibers and CN cells. In contrast, at high stimulation rates (500 pps and higher), AN fibers and many VCN cells exhibited "primary-like", "onset" and some other discharge patterns resembling those produced by natural sound stimuli. Unlike cells in the VCN, principal cells (pyramidal, giant) of the dorsal CN did not follow the stimulating pulses even at low rates. Instead, they often showed "pauser" and "build-up" patterns of activity, characteristic for these cells in conditions of normal hearing. We hypothesize that, at low stimulation rates, the response behavior of AN fibers and VCN cells is different from the patterns of neuronal activity related to normal auditory processing, whereas high stimulation rates produce more physiologically meaningful discharge patterns. The observed differences in discharge properties of AN fibers and CN cells at different stimulation rates can contribute to significant advantages of high- versus low-rate electrical stimulation of the AN used for coding sounds in modern cochlear implants.},

	abstract = {Bushy cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus are time-coding neurons. They receive axosomatic synaptic terminals from the auditory nerve, the so-called endbulb of Held synapses and project to sound localization centers in the superior olivary complex. Bushy cells are specialized to maintain and even improve the temporal code contained in the auditory nerve activity. In the present review an overview is given of the dynamic features and convergent inputs that modulate the response of bushy cells to auditory stimuli. The biophysics and synaptic specializations and dynamics of these neurons were studied extensively. These studies will be reviewed briefly in the initial part of this paper. In addition to auditory nerve input, powerful but slow inhibitory inputs act on bushy cells. Studies on these inhibitory inputs to bushy cells are discussed as part of this review. Furthermore, evidence for four classes of additional or secondary inputs that also impinge on the bushy cells will be reviewed: 1) small auditory nerve boutons, 2) commissural connections that are either inhibitory or excitatory, 3) multimodal inputs from somatosensory nuclei and 4) descending modulatory axons employing monoaminergic transmitters all interact with the main auditory nerve input in the bushy cells. The present article aims at reviewing how complex the influences on neuronal processing are, already in this early stage of the auditory pathway. It is concluded that the various modulatory influences help to better adapt bushy cell coding functions to dynamics of the sensory world.},

Measures were obtained from acutely deafened cats to examine time-related changes free from the effects of hair-cell and synaptic adaptation. Such data relate to adaptation that likely occurs in ANFs of cochlear-implant users. A major goal was to determine and compare rate adaptation observed at different pulse rates (primarily 250, 1000, and 5000 pulse/s) and describe them using decaying exponential models similar to those used in acoustic studies. Rate-vs.-time functions were best described by two-exponent models and produced time constants similar to (although slightly greater than) the "rapid" and "short-term" components described in acoustic studies. There was little dependence of these time constants on onset spike rate, but pulse-rate effects were noted. Spike amplitude changes followed a time course different from that of rate adaptation consistent with a process related to ANF interspike intervals. The fact that two time constants governed rate adaptation in electrically stimulated and deafened fibers suggests that future computational models of adaptation should not only include hair cell and synapse components, but also components determined by fiber membrane characteristics. © 2007 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.},

	abstract = {As cochlear implants have become increasingly successful in the rehabilitation of adults with profound hearing impairment, the number of pediatric implant subjects has increased. We have developed an animal model of congenital deafness and investigated the effect of electrical stimulus frequency on the temporal resolution of central neurons in the developing auditory system of deaf cats. Maximum following frequencies (Fmax) and response latencies of isolated single neurons to intracochlear electrical pulse trains (charge balanced, constant current biphasic pulses) were recorded in the contralateral inferior colliculus (IC) of two groups of neonatally deafened, barbiturate-anesthetized cats: animals chronically stimulated with low-frequency signals (≤80 Hz) and animals receiving chronic high-frequency stimulation (≥300 pps). The results were compared with data from unstimulated, acutely deafened and implanted adult cats with previously normal hearing (controls). Characteristic differences were seen between the temporal response properties of neurons in the external nucleus (ICX; {\textasciitilde}16\% of the recordings) and neurons in the central nucleus (ICC; {\textasciitilde}81\% of all recordings) of the IC: 1) in all three experimental groups, neurons in the ICX had significantly lower Fmax and longer response latencies than those in the ICC. 2) Chronic electrical stimulation in neonatally deafened cats altered the temporal resolution of neurons exclusively in the ICC but not in the ICX. The magnitude of this effect was dependent on the frequency of the chronic stimulation. Specifically, low-frequency signals (30 pps, 80 pps) maintained the temporal resolution of ICC neurons, whereas higher-frequency stimuli significantly improved temporal resolution of ICC neurons (i.e., higher Fmax and shorter response latencies) compared with neurons in control cats. Furthermore, Fmax and latencies to electrical stimuli were not correlated with the tonotopic gradient of the ICC, and changes in temporal resolution following chronic electrical stimulation occurred uniformly throughout the entire ICC. In all three experimental groups, increasing Fmax was correlated with shorter response latencies. The results indicate that the temporal features of the chronically applied electrical signals critically influence temporal processing of neurons in the cochleotopically organized ICC. We suggest that such plastic changes in temporal processing of central auditory neurons may contribute to the intersubject variability and gradual improvements in speech recognition performance observed in clinical studies of deaf children using cochlear implants.},

	abstract = {Deaf people who use cochlear implants show surprisingly poor sensitivity to the temporal fine structure of sounds. One possible reason is that conventional cochlear implants cannot activate selectively the auditory-nerve fibers having low characteristic frequencies (CFs), which, in normal hearing, phase lock to stimulus fine structure. Recently, we tested in animals an alternative mode of auditory prosthesis using penetrating auditory-nerve electrodes that permit frequency-specific excitation in all frequency regions.Wepresent here measures of temporal transmission through the auditory brainstem, from pulse trains presented with various auditory-nerve electrodes to phaselocked activity of neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC).Onaverage, intraneural stimulation resulted in significant ICC phase locking at higher pulse rates (i.e., higher "limiting rates") than did cochlear-implant stimulation. That could be attributed, however, to the larger percentage of low-CF neurons activated selectively by intraneural stimulation. Most ICC neurons with limiting rates {\textgreater}500 pulses per second had CFs {\textless}1.5 kHz, whereas neurons with lower limiting rates tended to have higher CFs. High limiting rates also correlated strongly with short first-spike latencies. It follows that short latencies correlated significantly with low CFs, opposite to the correlation observed with acoustical stimulation. These electrical- stimulation results reveal a high-temporal-acuity brainstem pathway characterized by low CFs, short latencies, and high-fidelity transmission of periodic stimulation. Frequency-specific stimulation of that pathway by intraneural stimulation might improve temporal acuity in human users of a future auditory prosthesis, which in turn might improve musical pitch perception and speech reception in noise.

In experiment 1, the hypothesis that listeners' modulation sensitivity would in part determine their ability to discriminate between temporal modulation rates was examined. Temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) obtained in an amplitude modulation detection (AMD) task were compared to threshold functions obtained in an amplitude modulation rate discrimination (AMRD) task. Statistically significant nonlinear correlations were observed between the two measures. In experiment 2, results of loudness-balancing showed small increases in the loudness of modulated over unmodulated stimuli beyond a modulation depth of 16\%. Results of experiment 3 indicated small but statistically significant effects of level-roving on the overall gain of the TMTF, but no impact of level-roving on the average shape of the TMTF across subjects. This suggested that level-roving simply increased the task difficulty for most listeners, but did not indicate increased use of intensity cues under more challenging conditions. Data obtained with one subject, however, suggested that the most sensitive listeners may derive some benefit from intensity cues in these tasks. Overall, results indicated that intensity cues did not play an important role in temporal envelope processing by the average CI listener.},

	abstract = {To further understand the response of the human brainstem to electrical stimulation, a series of experiments compared the effect of pulse rate and polarity on detection thresholds between auditory brainstem implant (ABI) and cochlear implant (CI) patients. Experiment 1 showed that for 400-ms pulse trains, ABI users’ thresholds dropped by about 2 dB as pulse rate was increased from 71 to 500 pps, but only by an average of 0.6 dB as rate was increased further to 3500 pps. This latter decrease was much smaller than the 7.7-dB observed for CI users. A similar result was obtained for pulse trains with a 40-ms duration. Furthermore, experiment 2 showed that the threshold difference between 500- and 3500-pps pulse trains remained much smaller for ABI than for CI users, even for durations as short as 2 ms, indicating the effect of a fast-acting mechanism. Experiment 3 showed that ABI users’ thresholds were lower for alternating-polarity than for fixed-polarity pulse trains, and that this difference was greater at 3500 pps than at 500 pps, consistent with the effect of pulse rate on ABI users’ thresholds being influenced by charge interactions between successive biphasic pulses. Experiment 4 compared thresholds and loudness between trains of asymmetric pulses of opposite polarity, in monopolar mode, and showed that in both cases less current was needed when the anodic, rather than the cathodic, current was concentrated into a short time interval. This finding is similar to that previously observed for CI users and is consistent with ABI users being more sensitive to anodic than cathodic current. We argue that our results constrain potential explanations for the differences in the perception of electrical stimulation by CI and ABI users, and have potential implications for future ABI stimulation strategies.},

	abstract = {The auditory midbrain implant (AMI), which is designed for stimulation of the inferior colliculus (IC), is now in clinical trials. The AMI consists of a single shank array (20 contacts) and uses a stimulation strategy originally designed for cochlear implants since it is already approved for human use and we do not yet know how to optimally activate the auditory midbrain. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of different pulse rates and phase durations on loudness and pitch percepts because these parameters are required to implement the AMI stimulation strategy. Although each patient was implanted into a different region (i.e. lateral lemniscus, central nucleus of IC, dorsal cortex of IC), they generally exhibited similar threshold versus phase duration, threshold versus pulse rate, and pitch versus pulse rate curves. In particular, stimulation with 100 μs/phase, 250 pulse per second (pps) pulse trains achieved an optimal balance among safety, energy, and current threshold requirements while avoiding rate pitch effects. However, we observed large differences across patients in loudness adaptation to continuous pulse stimulation over long time scales. One patient (implanted in dorsal cortex of IC) even experienced complete loudness decay and elevation of thresholds with daily stimulation. Comparing these results with those of cochlear implant and auditory brainstem implant patients, it appears that stimulation of higher order neurons exhibits less and even no loudness summation for higher rate stimuli and greater current leakage for longer phase durations than that of cochlear neurons. The fact that all midbrain regions we stimulated, which includes three distinctly different nuclei, exhibited similar loudness summation effects (i.e. none for pulse rates above 250 pps) suggests a possible shift in some coding properties that is affected more by which stage along the auditory pathway rather than the types of neurons are being stimulated. However, loudness adaptation occurs at multiple stages from the cochlea up to the midbrain. © 2008 IBRO.},

	abstract = {Central auditory processing in humans was investigated by comparing the perceptual effects of temporal parameters of electrical stimulation in auditory midbrain implant (AMI) and cochlear implant (CI) users. Four experiments were conducted to measure the following: effect of interpulse intervals on detection thresholds and loudness; temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs); effect of duration on detection thresholds; and forward masking decay. The CI data were consistent with a phenomenological model that based detection or loudness decisions on the output of a sliding temporal integration window, the input to which was the hypothetical auditory nerve response to each stimulus pulse. To predict the AMI data, the model required changes to both the neural response input (i.e., midbrain activity to AMI stimuli, compared to auditory nerve activity to CI stimuli) and the shape of the integration window. AMI data were consistent with a neural response that decreased more steeply compared to CI stimulation as the pulse rate increased or interpulse interval decreased. For one AMI subject, the data were consistent with a significant adaptation of the neural response for rates above 200 Hz. The AMI model required an integration window that was significantly wider (i.e., decreased temporal resolution) than that for CI data, the latter being well fit using the same integration window shape as derived from normal-hearing data. These models provide a useful way to conceptualize how stimulation of central auditory structures differs from stimulation of the auditory nerve and to better understand why AMI users have difficulty processing temporal cues important for speech understanding. © 2012 The Author(s).},

To create reduced-electrode processors the output of several adjacent filters were directed to a single electrode, resulting in processors with 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 20 electrodes. The overall spectral bandwidth was preserved, but the number of active electrodes was progressively reduced. After a 2-day period of adjustment to each processor, speech recognition performance was measured on medial consonants, vowels, monosyllabic words, and sentences. Performance with a single electrode processor was poor in all listeners, and average performance increased dramatically on all test materials as the number of electrodes was increased from 1 to 4. No differences in average performance were observed on any test in the 7-, 10-, and 20-electrode conditions. On sentence and consonant tests there was no difference between average performance with the 4-electrode and 20-electrode processors.

Temporal (synchronized) and mean-rate measures were derived from period histograms locked to the stimulus modulation waveform to characterize the modulation response. For stimuli presented in quiet, the modulation gain at low frequencies of modulation (approx {\textless} 50 Hz) was inversely proportional to the neuron's mean firing rate in response to both the modulated stimulus and to a pure tone at an equivalent level. In 43\% of units the mean discharge rates in response to the AM stimuli were greatest for those modulation frequencies that generated the largest temporal responses. These discharge-rate maxima occurred at signal intensities corresponding to the steeply sloping part of the neuron's pure-tone rate-intensity function (RIF). The change in mean-rate response to modulated stimuli, as a function of intensity, was qualitatively similar to the pure-tone RIF. Adding broadband noise to the modulated stimulus increased the neuron's temporal response to low modulation frequencies. This increase in modulation gain was correlated with mean firing rate in response to the modulation but did not bear a simple relationship to the noise-induced shift in the RIF measured for a pure tone. © 1989, Acoustical Society of America.

	abstract = {Objective: To develop and implement a new audiological fitting procedure for auditory brain stem implants (ABIs), based on an efficient algorithm, and to compare it with two procedures presently used in clinical practice. Design: First, the different procedures were compared by using computer models and simulations with normal-hearing subjects (N = 4). This allows for an analysis of the accuracy of the procedures in a way that is not possible when testing ABI users. The root-mean-square error between the order estimated by the procedure and the true order was calculated. In addition, ABI users (N = 2) were tested with the new procedure to see if it could be successfully applied in clinic. The degree of variability of their results across runs and sessions was analyzed. Results: The tests of the normal-hearing subjects showed that our proposed procedure required significantly fewer trials (22 on average) than procedures presently used in clinic (with 76 and 234 trials on average for the two other procedures tested) to produce the same degree of accuracy. Computer modeling also demonstrated this advantage. Additional testing showed this advantage was maintained under a variety of conditions relevant to the clinic. The two patients tested were able to use this procedure with success, even though they were poor at discriminating the pitch of electrodes. The patients showed results consistent with having about 4 to 5 discriminable groups of electrodes with the 12 to 14 electrodes tested. Conclusions: The proposed procedure requires fewer trials to produce a clinically useful result and is well tolerated in the clinic. An additional advantage is that it allows testing to be broken down into several "blocks," each containing a small number of trials. If the variability between blocks is small, information can be combined across blocks to increase the accuracy of the result. If the variability is large, perhaps between blocks on different days, this may reflect a significant change in the percepts generated by the implant, and signal to the clinician that a significant alteration in the fitting is required. We recommend its use in ABI user fitting and in cochlear implant fitting when pitch ranking is problematic. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {1. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a pervasive property of acoustic communication systems. In the present study we investigate neural temporal mechanisms in the auditory nerve and cochlear nuclei of the pentobarbital sodium-anesthesized cat associated with the neural coding of 100\% AM tones, both in quiet and in the presence of wideband, quasi-flat-spectrum noise. The AM carrier frequency was set to the neuron's characteristic frequency (CF) and the sound pressure level (SPL) of acoustic stimuli was varied over a wide dynamic range of intensities (≤40 dB). The temporal AM-encoding capability of auditory neurons was measured by computing the synchronization coefficient (SC) of the neural response to the signal's modulation and carrier frequency. The temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) of a neuron was then computed by measuring the SC of the response to signals of variable f(mod)(50-2550 Hz). 2. Neurons in the cochlear nuclei synchronize on average more highly to the modulation frequency than fibers of comparable CF, threshold, and spontaneous rate in the auditory nerve. The disparity in performance is greatest at high SPLs and low signal-to-noise ratios. However, there is a significant degree of diversity in AM-encoding capability among neurons in both the cochlear nuclei and auditory nerve. Among auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), low- and medium-spontaneous-rate (SR) units (SR {\textless}18 spike/s) phase-lock with greater precision than comparable high-SR units at any given frequency, particularly at moderate to high SPLs, consistent with previous studies. 3. The phase-locking capabilities of neurons in the cochlear nucleus are considerably more variable than in the auditory nerve. Moreover, the variability itself depends on two distinct measures of phase-locking performance. Most ANFs are capable of phase-locking to frequencies as high as 3-4 kHz. In the cochlear nucleus many unit types do not phase-lock to modulation frequencies {\textgreater}1 kHz. As a result, phase-locking performance is measured on the basis of two parameters, maximum synchronization, irrespective of stimulus frequency, and the upper frequency limit for significant phase-locking. 4. Cochlear nucleus neurons may be divided into three distinct groups on the basis of maximum synchronization capability. In group 1 are the primary-like (PL) units of the anteroventral division, whose phase-locking capabilities are comparable with those of high-SR ANFs. A second group, comprising the chopper (C), onset-L (O(L)) and pauser-buildup (P/B) unit types, exhibits phase-locking capability superior to that of PL units in response to low-frequency tones and AM signals and roughly equal to that of low-SR ANFs. A third group, consisting of the onset-chopper (O(C)) and primary-like-with-notch (PL(N)) units, exhibits phase-locking capability to AM signals that is considerably enhanced relative to that of groups 1 and 2. 5. The upper frequency limit of robust phase-locked AM encoding is described by the corner and cutoff frequencies of the tMTF. These upper limits are highly correlated with characteristic frequency for ANFs (and to a lesser extent, for PL and O(L) units) with CFs {\textless}10 kHz. However, other cochlear nucleus unit response types show little if any correlation for CFs {\textgreater}2 kHz. Among high-CF units ANFs exhibit the most precise phase-locking to f(mod) {\textgreater}1.5 kHz. The average tMTF corner frequency for these units is 744 Hz. O(C), PL, and O(L) units are also capable of robustly phase-locking to f(mod) {\textgreater}1 kHz. On the other hand, C and P/B units rarely phase-lock well to f(mod) {\textgreater}600 Hz. The rank order for phase-locking capability to high f(mod) is: ANF {\textgreater} PL(N) {\textgreater} (O(L) = PL = O(C)) {\textgreater} C {\textgreater} P/B. 6. The ability to encode f(mod) degrades appreciably at higher SPLs for most ANFs and cochlear nuclei units. However, phase-locking performance of ANFs shows the greatest decline with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas O(C) and P/B units exhibit the least. The latter unit types are capable of encoding f(mod) information at intensities up to ≥80 dB SPL. 7. For AM signals with component frequencies {\textless}1-2 kHz, many units in the cochlear nucleus and auditory nerve phase-lock to both the f(mod) and component frequencies. Phase-locking to the signal components reflects the ability of cells to encode the fine temporal structure of the waveform. 8. The overwhelming majority of cells in the auditory nerve and cochlear nuclei retain their capability of encoding f(mod) at all but the lowest signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting that one function of phase-locking may be to preserve modulation information under noisy background conditions. 9. The physiological mechanisms responsible for modulation coding in the cochlear nuclei are diverse. The most important factor appears to be the presence of convergent, phase-locked afferent activity from the auditory nerve, particularly in the case of O(C) units, which function in a manner analogous to 'coincidence detectors.'},

	abstract = {Sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (AM) tones are frequently used in psychophysical and physiological studies, yet a comprehensive study on the coding of AM tones in the auditory nerve is lacking. AM responses of single auditory-nerve fibers of the cat are studied, systematically varying modulation depth, frequency, and sound level. Synchrony-level functions were nonmonotonic with maximum values that were inversely correlated with spontaneous rate (SR). In most fibers, envelope phase-locking showed a positive gain. Modulation transfer functions were uniformly low pass. Their corner frequency increased with characteristic frequency (CF), but changed little for CFs above 10 kHz. The highest modulation frequencies to which phase locking occurred were more than 0.8 oct lower than the highest frequencies to which phase locking to pure tones occurs. Cumulative, or unwrapped, phase increased linearly with modulation frequency: The slope was inversely related to CF, and slightly higher than group delays reported for pure tones. High SR, low CF fibers showed the poorest envelope phase locking. In some low CF fibers, phase locking increased at high levels, associated with “peak-splitting” phenomena. Changes in average rate due to modulation were small, and could be enhancement or suppression. © 1992, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cochlear implant speech processors transmit temporal features of sound as amplitude modulation of constant-rate electrical pulse trains. This study evaluated the central representation of amplitude modulation in the form of phase-locked firing of neurons in the auditory cortex. Anesthetized pigmented guinea pigs were implanted with cochlear electrode arrays. Stimuli were 254 pulse/s (pps) trains of biphasic electrical pulses, sinusoidally modulated with frequencies of 10-64 Hz and modulation depths of -40 to -5 dB re 100\% (i.e., 1-56.2\% modulation). Single- and multiunit activity was recorded from multisite silicon-substrate probes. The maximum frequency for significant phase locking (limiting modulation frequency) was ≥60 Hz for 42\% of recording sites, whereas phase locking to pulses of unmodulated pulse trains rarely exceeded 30 pps. The strength of phase locking to frequencies ≥40 Hz often varied nonmonotonically with modulation depth, commonly peaking at modulation depths around -15 to -10 dB. Cortical phase locking coded modulation frequency reliably, whereas a putative rate code for frequency was confounded by rate changes with modulation depth. Group delay computed from the slope of mean phase versus modulation frequency tended to increase with decreasing limiting modulation frequency. Neurons in cortical extragranular layers had lower limiting modulation frequencies than did neurons in thalamic afferent layers. Those observations suggest that the low-pass characteristic of cortical phase locking results from intracortical filtering mechanisms. The results show that cortical neurons can phase lock to modulated electrical pulse trains across the range of modulation frequencies and depths presented by cochlear implant speech processors.

	abstract = {In cochlear implant (CI) patients, temporal processing is often poorest at low listening levels, making perception difficult for low-amplitude temporal cues that are important for consonant recognition and/or speech perception in noise. It remains unclear how speech processor parameters such as stimulation rate and stimulation mode may affect temporal processing, especially at low listening levels. The present study investigated the effects of these parameters on modulation detection by six CI users. Modulation detection thresholds (MDTs) were measured as functions of stimulation rate, mode, and level. Results show that for all stimulation rate and mode conditions, modulation sensitivity was poorest at quiet listening levels, consistent with results from previous studies. MDTs were better with the lower stimulation rate, especially for quiet-to-medium listening levels. Stimulation mode had no significant effect on MDTs. These results suggest that, although high stimulation rates may better encode temporal information and widen the electrode dynamic range, CI patients may not be able to access these enhanced temporal cues, especially at the lower portions of the dynamic range. Lower stimulation rates may provide better recognition of weak acoustic envelope information.},

Rats make excellent models for the study of medical, biological, genetic, and behavioral phenomena given their adaptability, robustness, survivability, and intelligence. The rat's general anatomy and physiology of the auditory system is similar to that observed in humans, and this has led to their use for investigating the effect of noise overexposure on the mammalian auditory system. The current paper provides a review of the rat model for studying noise-induced hearing loss and highlights advancements that have been made using the rat, particularly as these pertain to noise dose and the hazardous effects of different experimental noise types. In addition to the traditional loss of auditory function following acoustic trauma, recent findings have indicated the rat as a useful model in observing alterations in neuronal processing within the central nervous system following noise injury. Furthermore, the rat provides a second animal model when investigating noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, as studies examining this in the rat model resemble the general patterns observed in mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the relevance of this animal model for furthering the authors' understanding of the effects of noise on structural, anatomical, physiological, and perceptual aspects of hearing.},

	abstract = {Optical stimulation is a paradigm-shifting approach to modulating neural activity that has the potential to overcome the issue of current spread that occurs with electrical stimulation by providing focused stimuli. But optical stimulation either requires high power infrared light or genetic modification of neurons to make them responsive to lower power visible light. This work examines optical activation of auditory neurons following optogenetic modification via AAV injection in two species (mouse and guinea pig). An Anc80 viral vector was used to express the channelrhodopsin variant ChR2-H134R fused to a fluorescent reporter gene under the control of the human synapsin-1 promoter. The AAV was administered directly to the cochlea (n = 33) or posterior semi-circular canal of C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) or to guinea pig cochleae (n = 6). Light (488 nm), electrical stimuli or the combination of these (hybrid stimulation) was delivered to the cochlea via a laser-coupled optical fibre and co-located platinum wire. Activation thresholds, spread of activation and stimulus interactions were obtained from multi-unit recordings from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of injected mice, as well as ChR2-H134R transgenic mice (n = 4). Expression of ChR2-H134R was examined by histology. In the mouse, transduction of auditory neurons by the Anc80 viral vector was most successful when injected at a neonatal age with up to 89\% of neurons transduced. Auditory neuron transductions were not successful in guinea pigs. Inferior colliculus responses to optical stimuli were detected in a cochleotopic manner in all mice with ChR2-H134R expression. There was a significant correlation between lower activation thresholds in mice and higher proportions of transduced neurons. There was no difference in spread of activation between optical stimulation and electrical stimulation provided by the light/electrical delivery system used here (optical fibre with bonded 25 µm platinum/iridium wire). Hybrid stimulation, comprised of sub-threshold optical stimulation to ‘prime’ or raise the excitability of the neurons, lowered the threshold for electrical activation in most cases, but the impact on excitation width was more variable compared to transgenic mice. This study demonstrates the impact of opsin expression levels and expression pattern on optical and hybrid stimulation when considering optical or hybrid stimulation techniques for neuromodulation.},

In contrast, double-labeled cells were common in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, where cells frequently contained the two tracers that were injected into the ipsilateral and contralateral inferior colliculi. The distribution and somatic morphology of cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus that project to each of the three targets were examined.

Data were collected from 38 units with best frequencies (BFs) from 2.16 to 50.3 kHz with the use of electrode penetrations along the long (strial) axis of the DCN; an additional 11 units from a previous study were analyzed. A stereotypical type IV response map is defined as consisting of two excitatory and two inhibitory regions. Type IV units from both the pyramidal cell layer (probably pyramidal cells) and the deep layer (probably giant cells) show the same types of response maps. 2. Two of the regions, one excitatory and one inhibitory, are seen in all type IV units. These regions are a low-threshold excitatory region at best frequency (BFER) and an inhibitory area at higher levels, usually centered below BF but extending upward in frequency to include BF (central inhibitory area, or CIA). The high resolution of the response maps in this paper allows us to show that type IV units fall into two groups on the basis of whether their CIAs are narrow with well-defined borders (35 units) or broad with poorly defined borders (14 units). 3. Two additional features of type IV response maps can be defined, most consistently in units with well-defined CIAs. These features are an excitatory region along the high-frequency edge of the CIA (upper excitatory region, UER) and an upper inhibitory sideband (UIS). The BFER and UER are continuous in many units, but in some cases their continuity is broken by the CIA. It seems likely that the BFER and UER represent a single excitatory input to type IV units and are revealed because the tuning curve of the stronger inhibitory inputs that produce the CIA has thresholds greater than and BFs lower than the excitatory inputs. 4. The CIA is probably produced by inhibitory inputs from DCN type II neurons. The bandwidths of type IV CIAs are about 1-3 times larger (at 40 dB above threshold) than the excitatory bandwidths of DCN type II units, suggesting a convergence of the equivalent in tuning of about two type II units onto each type IV unit. The BF of the CIA is below the excitatory BF of the type IV unit in most cases. 5. Responses of type IV units to notch noise, which is band-reject filtered noise with the center of the stop band placed at BF, were recorded. Plots of discharge rate versus notch width were constructed with the use of these data. These plots show excitatory responses to noise with narrow notches (less than a few kilohertz for units with BFs {\textgreater} 10 kHz) and inhibitory responses to noise with wider notches. 6. Units' response maps are used to generate predicted responses to notch noise signals, with the result that the responses of DCN neurons to the notch noise cannot be explained by a model in which stimulus energy in different frequency bands is weighted according to the response map and summed to produce the unit's output (quasilinear energy summation). The model predictions for narrow notches are usually the inverse of the actual responses of the units. However, the notch noise responses are consistent with response map features to the limited extent that there is a general correspondence between the width of the BFER a few decibels above threshold and the notch width at which the excitatory responses disappear. The notch noise data point up the fundamental nonlinearity of energy summation in DCN units and demonstrate the need for more sophisticated analysis of input-output relationships in this structure. These results can be explained, at least qualitatively, in terms of preliminary results on the organization of response maps in type II units.},

Discharge rates sampled with this spectrum manipulation procedure (SMP) were used to estimate vowel representations provided by populations of VCN neurons. In traditional population measures, a good representation of a vowel's formant structure is based on relatively high discharge rates among units with BFs near high-energy formant features and low rates for units with BFs near low-energy spectral troughs. At most vowel levels and in the presence of background noise, chopper units exhibited formant-to-trough rate differences that were larger than VCN primary-like units and auditory-nerve fibers. By contrast, vowel encoding by primary-like units resembled auditory nerve representations for most stimulus conditions. As is seen in the auditory nerve, primary-like units with low spontaneous rates (SR {\textless} 18 spikes/s) produced better representations than high SR primary-like units at all but the lowest vowel levels. Awake cats exhibited the same general response properties as anesthetized cats but larger between- subject differences in vowel driven rates. The vowel encoding properties of VCN chopper units support previous interpretations that patterns of auditory nerve convergence on cochlear nucleus neurons compensate for limitations in the dynamic range of peripheral neurons.},

Ninety-five percent of people with VS present with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL); the mechanism of this SNHL is currently unknown. To establish the first model to study the role of VS-secreted factors in causing SNHL, murine cochlear explant cultures were treated with human tumour secretions from thirteen different unilateral, sporadic VSs of subjects demonstrating varied degrees of ipsilateral SNHL. The extent of cochlear explant damage due to secretion application roughly correlated with the subjects' degree of SNHL. Secretions from tumours associated with most substantial SNHL resulted in most significant hair cell loss and neuronal fibre disorganization. Secretions from VSs associated with good hearing or from healthy human nerves led to either no effect or solely fibre disorganization. Our results are the first to demonstrate that secreted factors from VSs can lead to cochlear damage. Further, we identified tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) as an ototoxic molecule and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) as an otoprotective molecule in VS secretions. Antibody-mediated TNFα neutralization in VS secretions partially prevented hair cell loss due to the secretions. Taken together, we have identified a new mechanism responsible for SNHL due to VSs.},

Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 95\% of patients with these tumors, but the cause of this loss is not well understood. We posit a role of VS-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a major contributing factor in cochlear nerve damage. Methods Using differential centrifugation, we isolated EVs from VS cell line HEI-193 and primary cultured human VS cells from patients with good hearing or poor hearing. The EVs were characterized using a Nanosight device and transmission electron microscopy and by extracting their RNA content. The EVs' effects on cultured murine spiral ganglion cells and organotypic cochlear cultures were studied using a transwell dual-culture system and by direct labeling of EVs with PKH-67 dye. EV-induced changes in cochlear cells were quantified using confocal immunohistochemistry. Transfection of VS cells with a green fluorescent protein-containing plasmid was confirmed with reverse transcription PCR. Results Human VS cells, from patients with poor hearing, produced EVs that could damage both cultured murine cochlear sensory cells and neurons. In contrast, EVs derived from VS cells from patients with good hearing did not damage the cultured cochlear cells. Conclusions This is the first report on EVs derived from VSs and on the capacity of EVs from VSs from patients with hearing loss to selectively damage cochlear cells, thereby identifying a potential novel mechanism of VS-associated sensorineural hearing loss.},

	abstract = {Sharp spatial selectivity is critical to auditory performance, particularly in pitch-related tasks. Most contemporary cochlear implants have employed monopolar stimulation that produces broad electric fields, which presumably contribute to poor pitch and pitch-related performance by implant users. Bipolar or tripolar stimulation can generate focused electric fields but requires higher current to reach threshold and, more interestingly, has not produced any apparent improvement in cochlear-implant performance. The present study addressed this dilemma by measuring psychophysical and physiological spatial selectivity with both broad and focused stimulations in the same cohort of subjects. Different current levels were adjusted by systematically measuring loudness growth for each stimulus, each stimulation mode, and in each subject. Both psychophysical and physiological measures showed that, although focused stimulation produced significantly sharper spatial tuning than monopolar stimulation, it could shift the tuning position or even split the tuning tips. The altered tuning with focused stimulation is interpreted as a result of poor electrode-to-neuron interface in the cochlea, and is suggested to be mainly responsible for the lack of consistent improvement in implant performance. A linear model could satisfactorily quantify the psychophysical and physiological data and derive the tuning width. Significant correlation was found between the individual physiological and psychophysical tuning widths, and the correlation was improved by log-linearly transforming the physiological data to predict the psychophysical data. Because the physiological measure took only one-tenth of the time of the psychophysical measure, the present model is of high clinical significance in terms of predicting and improving cochlear-implant performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Herein we describe the ABI for family physicians. Methods: PubMed was searched to identify articles relevant to the ABI, as well as articles that contain outcomes data for pediatric patients (age {\textless}18 years) who have undergone ABI surgery. Results: The ABI was originally developed for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who become deaf from bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Over the past decade, indications for an ABI have expanded to adult patients without tumors (without NF2) who cannot receive a CI and children with no cochlea or cochlear nerve. Outcomes among NF2 ABI users are modest compared to cochlear implant patients, but recent studies from Europe suggest that some non-tumor adult and pediatric ABI users achieve speech perception. Conclusion: The ABI is a reasonable surgical option for children with profound hearing loss due to severe cochlear or cochlear nerve deformities. Continued prospective data collection from several clinical trials in the U.S. will provide greater understanding on long term outcomes that focus on speech intelligibility.},

ABI indications have recently extended to children with congenital deafness who are not cochlear implant candidates. Few multi-institutional outcome data exist. Herein, we aim to provide a systematic review of outcomes following implantation of the ABI in pediatric patients with nontumor diagnosis, with a focus on audiometric outcomes. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Review Methods A systematic review of literature was performed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) recommendations. Variables assessed included age at implantation, diagnosis, medical history, cochlear implant history, radiographic findings, ABI device implanted, surgical approach, complications, side effects, and auditory outcomes. Results The initial search identified 304 articles; 21 met inclusion criteria for a total of 162 children. The majority of these patients had cochlear nerve aplasia (63.6\%, 103 of 162). Cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in up to 8.5\% of cases. Audiometric outcomes improved over time. After 5 years, almost 50\% of patients reached Categories of Auditory Performance scores {\textgreater}4; however, patients with nonauditory disabilities did not demonstrate a similar increase in scores. Conclusion ABI surgery is a reasonable option for the habilitation of deaf children who are not cochlear implant candidates.

Speech perception outcomes for ABI users are typically poor compared with most CI users. The ABI is implanted either on the surface of or penetrating through the cochlear nucleus in the auditory brain stem and uses stimulation strategies developed for auditory nerve stimulation with a CI. Although the stimulus rate may affect speech perception outcomes with current stimulation strategies, no studies have systematically investigated the effect of stimulus rate electrophysiologically or clinically. We therefore investigated rate response properties and temporal response properties of single inferior colliculus (IC) neurons from penetrating ABI stimulation using stimulus rates ranging from 100 to 1,600 pulses/s in the rat. We found that the stimulus rate affected the proportion of response types, thresholds, and dynamic ranges of IC activation. The stimulus rate was also found to affect the temporal properties of IC responses, with higher rates providing more temporally similar responses to acoustic stimulation. Suppression of neural firing and inhibition in IC neurons was also found, with response properties varying with the stimulus rate. This study demonstrated that changes in the ABI stimulus rate results in significant differences in IC neuron response properties. Due to electrophysiological differences, the stimulus rate may also change perceptual properties. We suggest that clinical evaluation of the ABI stimulus rate should be performed. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

Mechanistic clues can be revealed by applying labelling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridisation to brain tissue sections. Precision in both assigning anatomical location to the sections and quantifying labelled features is crucial for output validity, with a stereological approach or image-based feature extraction typically used. However, both approaches are restricted by the need to manually delineate anatomical regions. To circumvent this limitation, we present the QUINT workflow for quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in series of rodent brain section images based on available 3D reference atlases. The workflow is semi-automated, combining three open source software that can be operated without scripting knowledge, making it accessible to most researchers. As an example, a brain region-specific quantification of amyloid plaques across whole transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain series, immunohistochemically labelled for three amyloid-related antigens is demonstrated. First, the whole brain image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to produce customised atlas maps adapted to match the cutting plan and proportions of the sections (QuickNII software). Second, the labelling was segmented from the original images by the Random Forest Algorithm for supervised classification (ilastik software). Finally, the segmented images and atlas maps were used to generate plaque quantifications for each region in the reference atlas (Nutil software). The method yielded comparable results to manual delineations and to the output of a stereological method. While the use case demonstrates the QUINT workflow for quantification of amyloid plaques only, the workflow is suited to all mouse or rat brain series with labelling that is visually distinct from the background, for example for the quantification of cells or labelled proteins.},

Round window membrane injection resulted in highly efficient transduction of inner and outer hair cells in mice, a substantial improvement over conventional AAV vectors. Anc80L65 round window injection was well tolerated, as indicated by sensory cell function, hearing and vestibular function, and immunologic parameters.

	abstract = {The cochlear implant is the most successful bionic prosthesis and has transformed the lives of people with profound hearing loss. However, the performance of the "bionic ear" is still largely constrained by the neural interface itself. Current spread inherent to broad monopolar stimulation of the spiral ganglion neuron somata obviates the intrinsic tonotopic mapping of the cochlear nerve.We show in the guinea pig that neurotrophin gene therapy integrated into the cochlear implant improves its performance by stimulating spiral ganglion neurite regeneration. We used the cochlear implant electrode array for novel "close-field" electroporation to transduce mesenchymal cells lining the cochlear perilymphatic canals with a naked complementary DNA gene construct driving expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. The focusing of electric fields by particular cochlear implant electrode configurations led to surprisingly efficient gene delivery to adjacent mesenchymal cells. The resulting BDNF expression stimulated regeneration of spiral ganglion neurites,which had atrophied 2weeks after ototoxic treatment, in a bilateral sensorineural deafness model. In this model, delivery of a control GFP-only vector failed to restore neuron structure, with atrophied neurons indistinguishable from unimplanted cochleae. With BDNF therapy, the regenerated spiral ganglion neurites extended close to the cochlear implant electrodes, with localized ectopic branching. This neural remodeling enabled bipolar stimulation via the cochlear implant array, with low stimulus thresholds and expanded dynamic range of the cochlear nerve, determined via electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses. This development may broadly improve neural interfaces and extend molecular medicine applications.},

	abstract = {Object. Development of multichannel auditory brainstem implant (ABI) systems has been based in part on the assumption that audiological outcome can be optimized by increasing the number of available electrodes. In this paper the authors critically analyze this assumption on the basis of a retrospective clinical study performed using the Nucleus 22 ABI surface electrode array. Methods. The perceptual performances of 61 patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2 were tested approximately 6 weeks after an eight-electrode ABI had been implanted. Of eight implanted electrodes 5.57 ± 2.57 (mean ± standard deviation [SD] provided auditory sensations when stimulated. Electrodes were deactivated when stimulation resulted in significant nonauditory side effects or no auditory sensation at all, and also when they failed to provide distinctive pitch sensations. The mean (± SD) scores for patients with ABIs were the following: sound-only consonant recognition, 20.4 ± 14.3 (range 0-65\%); vowel recognition, 28.8 ± 18\% (range 0-67\%); Monosyllable Trochee Spondee (MTS) word recognition 41.1 ± 25.3\% (range 0-100\%); and sentence recognition, 5.3 ± 11.4\% (range 0-64\%). Performance in patients in whom between one and three electrodes provided auditory sensation was significantly poorer than that in patients with between four and eight functional electrodes in the vowel, MTS word, and City University of New York (CUNY) sentence recognition tests. The correlation between performance and electrode number did not reach the 0.05 level of significance with respect to the sound effect, consonant, and MTS stress-pattern recognition tests, probably because a satisfactory performance in these tests can be obtained only with temporal cues, that is, without any information about the frequency of the sounds. In the MTS word and the CUNY sentence recognition tests, performance was optimal in the patients with eight functional electrodes. Although all top performers had more than three functional auditory electrodes, no further improvement (asymptotic performance) was seen in those with five or more active electrodes in the consonant, vowel, and sound effect recognition tests. Conclusions. A minimum of three spectral channels, programmed in the appropriate individual tonotopic order seem to be required for satisfactory speech recognition in most patients with ABI. Due to the limited access to the tonotopic frequency gradient of the cochlear nucleus with surface stimulation, patients with ABI do not receive a wide range of spectral cues (frequency information) with multielectrode ({\textgreater} 5) surface arrays.},

	abstract = {The emergence of optogenetics technology facilitated widespread applications for interrogation of complex neural networks, such as activation of specific axonal pathways, previously found impossible with electrical stimulation. Consequently, within the short period of its application in neuroscience research, optogenetics has led to findings of significant importance both during normal brain function as well as in disease. Moreover, the optimization of optogenetics for in vivo studies has allowed the control of certain behavioral responses such as motility, reflex, and sensory responses, as well as more complex emotional and cognitive behaviors such as decision-making, reward seeking, and social behavior in freely moving animals. These studies have produced a wide variety of animal models that have resulted in fundamental findings and enhanced our understanding of the neural networks associated with behavior. The increasing number of opsins available for this technique enabled even broader regulation of neuronal activity. These advancements highlight the potential of this technique for future treatment of human diseases. Here, we provide an overview of the recent developments in the field of optogenetics technology that are relevant for a better understanding of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and may pave the way for future therapeutic interventions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Invasive brain computer interface (BCI) devices are limited by mechanical mismatching and cellular reactive responses due to differences in the elastic modulus and the motion of stiff electrodes. We propose a mesh-shaped electrode to enhance the contactability between surface of dura and electrode. Approach. We designed a polyimide (PI) electrode with a mesh pattern for more conformal contact with a curved surface. We compared the contact capability of mesh PI electrodes with conventionally used sheet PI electrode. The electrical properties of the mesh PI electrode were evaluated for four weeks. We recorded the epidural ECoG (eECoG) activity on the surface of rhesus monkey brains while they performed a saccadic task for four months. Main results. The mesh PI electrode showed good contact with the agarose brain surface, as evaluated by visual inspection and signal measurement. It was about 87\% accurate in predicting the direction of saccade eye movement. Significance. Our results indicate that the mesh PI electrode was flexible and good contact on the curved surface and can record eECoG activity maintaining close contact to dura, which was proved by in vivo and in vitro test. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to help to establish the feasibility of a multi-channel auditory prosthesis based on microstimulation within the human ventral cochlear nucleus, and to define the range of stimulus parameters that can be used safely with such a device. We chronically implanted activated iridium microelectrodes into the feline ventral cochlear nucleus and, beginning 80-250 days after implantation, they were pulsed for 7 h/day, on up to 21 successive days. The stimulus was charge-balanced pulses whose amplitude was modulated by a simulated human voice. The pulse rate (250 Hz/electrode) and the maximum pulse amplitude were selected as those that are likely to provide a patient with useful auditory percepts. The changes in neuronal responses during the multi-day stimulation regimens were partitioned into long-lasting, stimulation-induced depression of neuronal excitability (SIDNE), and short-acting neuronal refractivity (SANR). Both SIDNE and SANR were quantified from the changes in the growth functions of the evoked potentials recorded in the inferior colliculus. All of the stimulation regimens that we tested induced measurable SIDNE and SANR. The combined effect of SIDNE and the superimposed SANR is to depress the neuronal response near threshold, and thereby, to depress the population response over the entire amplitude range of the stimulus pulses. SIDNE and SANR may cause the greatest degradation of the performance of a clinical device at the low end of the amplitude range, and this may represent an inherent limitation of this type of spatially localized, high-rate neuronal stimulation. We determined sets of stimulus parameters which preserved most of the dynamic range of the neuronal response, when using either long (150 μs/phase) or short (40 μs/phase) stimulus pulses. Increasing the amplitude of the stimulus was relatively ineffective as a means of increasing the dynamic range of neuronal response, since the greater stimulus amplitude induced more SIDNE. All of the pulsed and unpulsed electrode sites were examined histologically, and no neuronal changes attributable to the stimulation were detected. There was some aggregation of glial cells immediately adjacent to some of the electrodes that were pulsed with the short-duration pulses, and at the highest current densities.

	abstract = {Objective Micro-electrocorticography (μECoG) offers a minimally invasive neural interface with high spatial resolution over large areas of cortex. However, electrode arrays with many contacts that are individually wired to external recording systems are cumbersome and make recordings in freely-behaving rodents challenging. We report a novel high-density 60-electrode system for μECoG recording in freely-moving rats. Approach Multiplexed headstages overcome the problem of wiring complexity by combining signals from many electrodes to a smaller number of connections We have developed a low-cost, multiplexed recording system with 60 contacts at 406 μm spacing. We characterized the quality of the electrode signals using multiple metrics that tracked spatial variation, evoked-response detectability, and decoding value. Performance of the system was validated both in anesthetized animals and freely-moving awake animals. Main results We recorded μECoG signals over the primary auditory cortex, measuring responses to acoustic stimuli across all channels. Single-trial responses had high signal-to-noise ratios (up to 25 dB under anesthesia), and were used to rapidly measure network topography within {\textasciitilde}10 seconds by constructing all single-channel receptive fields in parallel. We characterized evoked potential amplitudes and spatial correlations across the array in the anesthetized and awake animals. Recording quality in awake animals was stable for at least 30 days. Finally, we used these responses to accurately decode auditory stimuli on single trials. Significance This study introduces (1) a μECoG recording system based on practical hardware design and (2) a rigorous analytical method for characterizing the signal characteristics of μECoG electrode arrays. This methodology can be applied to evaluate the fidelity and lifetime of any μECoG electrode array. Our μECoG-based recording system is accessible and will be useful for studies of perception and decision-making in rodents, particularly over the entire time course of behavioral training and learning.},

	abstract = {Background: Auditory brainstem implants have failed to produce consistent clinical results comparable to those with the cochlear implant, both with surface and penetrating electrodes. Objective: To determine neuromorphological constraints of the auditory brainstem implant interface. Methods: The size, shape, surface depth, and spatial orientation of 33 human cochlear nuclei in 20 brainstem specimens obtained at autopsy were systematically analyzed in 792 slices each with a thickness of 8 μm. Three-dimensional renderings of the cochlear nucleus complex were obtained from a true-to-scale model, and the resulting photographic views were arranged according to the axes of the brainstem. Results: The dimensions of the ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes correlated linearly with each other. There were no significant side differences. Maximum dimensions of the whole cochlear nuclear complex were 8.01 × 1.53 × 3.76 mm. The appearance of the ventral and dorsal nuclei combined resembles a distorted X shape from a lateral view and an angulated wedge shape when viewed from above. Slanted into the depth of the brainstem above the facial nerve entrance, the superior boundary of the ventral nucleus is located more than 7 mm off the surface of the brainstem on average. Conclusion: In the absence of appropriate surface landmarks and imaging guidance, to gain tonotopic access to the human cochlear nucleus with surface and depth electrode remains a major challenge. Due to its location close to the surface, the dorsal cochlear nucleus is vulnerable to surgical manipulation and to tumors. © 2012 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

	abstract = {The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a region of particular interest for auditory and tinnitus research. However, lack of useful genetic markers for in vivo manipulations hinders elucidation of the DCN contribution to tinnitus pathophysiology. This work assesses whether adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) containing the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2a (CaMKIIa) promoter and a mouse line of nicotinic acetylcho-line receptor a2 subunit (Chrna2)-Cre can target specific DCN populations. We found that CaMKIIa cannot be used to target excitatory fusiform DCN neurons as labeled cells showed diverse morphology indicating they belong to different classes of DCN neurons. Light stimulation after driving Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) by the CaMKIIa promoter generated spikes in some units but firing rate decreased when light stimulation coincided with sound. Expression and activation of CaMKIIa-eArchaerhodopsin3.0 in the DCN produced inhibition in some units but sound-driven spikes were delayed by concomitant light stimulation. We explored the existence of Cre1 cells in the DCN of Chrna2-Cre mice by hydrogel embedding technique (CLARITY). There were almost no Cre1 cell bodies in the DCN; however, we identified profuse projections arising from the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). Anterograde labeling in the VCN revealed projections to the ipsilateral superior olive and con-tralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB; bushy cells), and a second bundle terminating in the DCN, suggesting the latter to be excitatory Chrna21 T-stellate cells. Exciting Chrna21 cells increased DCN firing. This work shows that cortical molecular tools may be useful for manipulating the DCN especially for tin-nitus studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The auditory brainstem implant (ABI) is a significant treatment to restore hearing sensations for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients. However, there is no ideal method in assisting the placement of ABIs. In this case series, intraoperative cochlear nucleus mapping was performed in awake craniotomy to help guide the placement of the electrode array. CASE SUMMARY We applied the asleep-awake-asleep technique for awake craniotomy and hearing test via the retrosigmoid approach for acoustic neuroma resections and ABIs, using mechanical ventilation with a laryngeal mask during the asleep phases, utilizing a ropivacaine-based regional anesthesia, and sevoflurane combined with propofol/remifentanil as the sedative/analgesic agents in four NF2 patients. ABI electrode arrays were placed in the awake phase with successful intraoperative hearing tests in three patients. There was one uncooperative patient whose awake hearing test needed to be aborted. In all cases, tumor resection and ABI were performed safely. Satisfactory electrode effectiveness was achieved in awake ABI placement. CONCLUSION This case series suggests that awake craniotomy with an intraoperative hearing test for ABI placement is safe and well tolerated. Awake craniotomy is beneficial for improving the accuracy of ABI electrode placement and meanwhile reduces non-auditory side effects.},

	abstract = {Recent work suggests that hair cells are not the most vulnerable elements in the inner ear; rather, it is the synapses between hair cells and cochlear nerve terminals that degenerate first in the aging or noise-exposed ear. This primary neural degeneration does not affect hearing thresholds, but likely contributes to problems understanding speech in difficult listening environments, and may be important in the generation of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. To look for signs of cochlear synaptopathy in humans, we recruited college students and divided them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on self-report of noise exposure and use of hearing protection. Cochlear function was assessed by otoacoustic emissions and click-evoked electrocochleography; hearing was assessed by behavioral audiometry and word recognition with or without noise or time compression and reverberation. Both groups had normal thresholds at standard audiometric frequencies, however, the high-risk group showed significant threshold elevation at high frequencies (10-16 kHz), consistent with early stages of noise damage. Electrocochleography showed a significant difference in the ratio between the waveform peaks generated by hair cells (Summating Potential; SP) vs. cochlear neurons (Action Potential; AP), i.e. the SP/AP ratio, consistent with selective neural loss. The high-risk group also showed significantly poorer performance on word recognition in noise or with time compression and reverberation, and reported heightened reactions to sound consistent with hyperacusis. These results suggest that the SP/AP ratio may be useful in the diagnosis of "hidden hearing loss" and that, as suggested by animal models, the noise-induced loss of cochlear nerve synapses leads to deficits in hearing abilities in difficult listening situations, despite the presence of normal thresholds at standard audiometric frequencies.},

The second cell, located in the octopus‐cell area, was a giant cell with a few somatic spines and thin tapering dendrites; the intracellular record revealed that even in the absence of sound it received continuous synaptic input, while tones at characteristic frequency produced a sustained depolarization. A third cell, which had an onset response at low intensities and a chopper response at high intensities, was a stellate cell located in the intermediate acoustic stria with dendrites oriented parallel to the fiber tract. This cell had an unusually broad dynamic range in response to changes in intensity. Two cells with transient chopper response patterns were stellate cells in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus with many branched and beaded dendrites. Three cells with more sustained chopper response patterns were stellate cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus with fewer, less‐branched, smooth dendrites. Two cells with primarylike responses to tones were bushy cells with numerous short, thin, highly branched dendrites in the posterior division of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Intracellular responses to tones at the characteristic frequency consisted of large brief depolarizations, which were not sustained. Another cell, which responded to tones in a phase‐locked fashion, was also located in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. It was a small, stellate cell with relatively few, smooth dendrites. The labeled cells largely support previous attempts at physiological‐morphological correlations: (1) bushy cells exhibit primarylike pattern; (2) stellate cells exhibit chopper patterns; and (3) octopus cells exhibit an onset pattern. It was also demonstrated that more than one cell type can exhibit a particular response pattern. Copyright © 1983 Alan R. Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

	abstract = {A litter of four cats, born and raised in a soundproofed chamber, was studied in an attempt to determine which, if any, features of the auditory-nerve response from routinely available cats might be due to the chronic effects of noise exposure. Two features of routine-normal response were especially suspect in this regard: (1) a “notch” in the distribution of single-unit thresholds centered at characteristic frequencies (CF's) near 3 kHz and (2) a compression of the distribution of rates of spontaneous discharge for units with CF above 10 kHz. A third feature of response in routine animals was the presence of a small number (roughly 10\%) of units with virtually no spontaneous discharge and very high thresholds, sometimes 80 dB less sensitive than high-spontaneous units of similar CF. In the data from chamber-raised animals, the high-spontaneous units showed exceptionally low thresholds at all CF regions, however, there were signs of the midfrequency notch in the threshold distribution of at least two of these animals. The compression of the spontaneous rate distribution was not seen in any of the three most sensitive animals. The data suggest that there is a significant amount of “normal pathology” in the high-CF units from routine animals. Low-spontaneous, high-threshold units were present in all four chamber-raised ears with the same characteristics as in routine animals (exceptionally narrow tuning curves and exceptionally low maximum discharge rates) and at roughly the same percentage of the unit sample. A class of units with medium spontaneous rates and intermediate thresholds could also be identified. The possible significance of a classification of auditory-nerve units according to spontaneous rate is discussed. © 1978, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Key points: Enhancing cortical excitability can be achieved by either reducing intracortical inhibition or by enhancing intracortical excitation. Here we compare the consequences of reducing intracortical inhibition and of enhancing intracortical excitation on the processing of communication sounds in the primary auditory cortex. Local application of gabazine and of AMPA enlarged the spectrotemporal receptive fields and increased the responses to communication to the same extent. The Mutual Information (an index of the cortical neurons’ ability to discriminate between natural sounds) was increased in both cases, as were the noise and signal correlations. Spike-timing reliability was only increased after gabazine application and post-excitation suppression was affected in the opposite way: it was increased when reducing the intracortical inhibition but was eliminated by enhancing the excitation. A computational model suggests that these results can be explained by an additive effect vs. a multiplicative effect. Abstract: The level of excitability of cortical circuits is often viewed as one of the critical factors controlling perceptive performance. In theory, enhancing cortical excitability can be achieved either by reducing inhibitory currents or by increasing excitatory currents. Here, we evaluated whether reducing inhibitory currents or increasing excitatory currents in auditory cortex similarly affects the neurons’ ability to discriminate between communication sounds. We attenuated the inhibitory currents by application of gabazine (GBZ), and increased the excitatory currents by applying AMPA in the auditory cortex while testing frequency receptive fields and responses to communication sounds. GBZ and AMPA enlarged the receptive fields and increased the responses to communication sounds to the same extent. The spike-timing reliability of neuronal responses was largely increased when attenuating the intracortical inhibition but not after increasing the excitation. The discriminative abilities of cortical cells increased in both cases but this increase was more pronounced after attenuating the inhibition. The shape of the response to communication sounds was modified in the opposite direction: reducing inhibition increased post-excitation suppression whereas this suppression tended to disappear when increasing the excitation. A computational model indicates that the additive effect promoted by AMPA vs. the multiplicative effect of GBZ on neuronal responses, together with the dynamics of spontaneous cortical activity, can explain these differences. Thus, although apparently equivalent for increasing cortical excitability, acting on inhibition vs. on excitation impacts differently the cortical ability to discriminate natural stimuli, and only modulating inhibition changed efficiently the cortical representation of communication sounds.},

At MED-EL, the early development activities on ABI started in the year 1994, with the suggestion coming from J. Helms and J. Müller from Würzburg, Germany in collaboration with the Univ. of Innsbruck Austria. The first ABI surgery in a neuro-fibromatosis (NF2) patient with the MED-EL device took place in the year 1997. Later, the indication of ABI was expanded to non-NF2 patients with severe inner-ear malformation, for whom a regular CI will not be beneficial. Key translational research activities at MED-EL in collaboration with numerous clinics investigating the factors that affect the hearing performance amongst ABI patients, importance of early ABI implantation in children, tools in pre-operative assessment of ABI candidates and new concepts that were pursued with the MED-EL ABI device. The CE-mark for the MED-EL ABI to be used in adults and children down to the age of 12 months without NF-2 was granted in 2017 mainly based on two long-term clinical studies in the pediatric population.

A further complication was noted in the most posterior portion of the AVCN where units with very different CF were found in close proximity.

	abstract = {Optogenetics comprise a promising alternative to electrical stimulation for characterization of neural circuits and for the next generation of neural prostheses. Optogenetic stimulation relies on expression of photosensitive microbial proteins in animal cells to initiate a flow of ions into the cells in response to visible light. Here, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model in which we studied the optogenetic activation of spiral ganglion neurons, the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and showed a strong optogenetic response, with a similar amplitude as the acoustically evoked response. A twofold increase in the level of channelrhodopsin expression significantly increased the photosensitivity at both the single cell and organismal levels but also partially compromised the native electrophysiological properties of the neurons. The importance of channelrhodopsin expression level to optogenetic stimulation, revealed by these quantitative measurements, will be significant for the characterization of neural circuitry and for the use of optogenetics in neural prostheses. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study reveals a dose-response relationship between channelrhodopsin expression and optogenetic excitation. Both single cell and organismal responses depend on the expression level of the heterologous protein. Expression level of the opsin is thus an important variable in determining the outcome of an optogenetic experiment. These results are key to the implementation of neural prostheses based on optogenetics, such as next generation cochlear implants, which would use light to elicit a neural response to sound.},

	abstract = {In the cat ventral cochlear nucleus, separate neuronal classes have been defined based on morphological characteristics; physiologically defined unit types have also been described based on the shape of post‐stimulus‐time‐histograms in response to tone bursts at characteristic frequency. The aim of the present study was to address directly the issue of how morphological cell types relate to physiological unit types. We used intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase to stain individual neurons after their response characteristics were determined by intracellular recordings. The maintenance of a continuous negative resting potential, the correspondence of the calculated position of the electrode tip at the time of injection to the location of the stained neuron, and the similarity of response properties collected before and after the injection provide evidence that the injected, stained, and recovered neuron corresponds to the functionally defined unit. In the region around the nerve root in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, two “primarylike” and one “primarylike with notch” units were “bushy” cells. “Bushy” cells are characterized by primary dendrites arising from one hemisphere of the soma and ramifying repeatedly to produce their bushy dendritic arbor. In this same region, the “chopper” and two “on” units were also “bushy” cells. In the posteroventral cochlear nucleus, the “chopper” unit was a “stellate” cell and the “on” unit was an “octopus” cell. These results are partially consistent with previous conclusions based on correlations established between the regional distribution of physiological unit types and morphological cell types. More importantly, they confirm and extend recent intracellular marking data (Rhode et al., ′83b). If our classification schemes have functional significance, we are left with the conclusion that the distinction between “bushy” and “stellate” cells in the auditory nerve root region of the ventral cochlear nucleus does not correspond in any simple way to distinctions between physiological unit types. More than one morphological cell type can exhibit the same particular response pattern, and the same morphological cell type can exhibit several different response patterns. Copyright © 1984 Alan R.

	doi = {10.1097/AUD.0b013e318230fff8},
	abstract = {Objectives: A major focus of recent attempts to enhance cochlear implant (CI) systems has been to increase the rate at which pulses are delivered to the electrode array. One basis for these attempts has been the expectation that faster stimulation rates would lead to an enhanced representation of temporal modulation information. However, there is recent physiological and behavioral evidence to suggest that the reverse may be the case. Here, the effects of stimulation rate on the perception of amplitude modulation were assessed using both modulation detection and modulation frequency discrimination tasks for a range of pulse rates extending considerably higher than the highest rate tested in previous studies and for different speech-relevant modulation frequencies. Design: Detection of sinusoidal amplitude modulation was assessed in five CI users using monopolar pulse trains presented to a single electrode at rates of 482, 723, 1447, 2894, and 5787 pulses per second (pps). Adaptive procedures were used to find the minimal detectable modulation depth at modulation frequencies of 10 and 100 Hz and at carrier levels of 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of the electrode's dynamic range. Discrimination of modulation frequency was examined for the same range of pulse rates for the highest carrier level. Similar adaptive procedures determined the minimum increase in modulation frequency that could be detected relative to reference modulation frequencies of 10, 100, and 200 Hz. In both tasks, level roving was implemented to minimize possible loudness cues. Results: Consistent with previous evidence, modulation detection thresholds were better for higher carrier levels and lower modulation frequencies. When modulation depth at threshold was expressed in terms of the ratio of the depth of the modulation and the carrier level in dB (i.e., 20 log m), performance was significantly better at lower pulse rates. However, when modulation depth was expressed relative to dynamic range, the effect of pulse rate was no longer significant, reflecting the fact that dynamic range increases with pulse rate. Modulation frequency discrimination clearly worsened with increasing modulation frequency, but there was no significant effect of pulse rate. Conclusions: In contrast to some recent evidence, no clearly harmful effect of higher pulse rates on modulation perception was found. However, even with very fast stimulation rates, tested over a wide range of modulation frequencies and with two different tasks, there is no evidence of benefit from faster stimulation rates in the perception of amplitude modulation.

While commercial CI have employed increasingly high stimulation rates, no clear or consistent advantage has been shown for high rates. In this study, speech recognition was acutely measured with experimental processors in 7 CI subjects (Clarion CII users). The stimulation rate varied between (approx.) 600 and 4800 pulses per second per electrode (ppse) and the number of active electrodes varied between 4 and 16. Vowel, consonant, consonant-nucleus-consonant word and IEEE sentence recognition was acutely measured in quiet and in steady noise (+10 dB signal-to-noise ratio). Subjective quality ratings were obtained for each of the experimental processors in quiet and in noise. Except for a small difference for vowel recognition in quiet, there were no significant differences in performance among the experimental stimulation rates for any of the speech measures. There was also a small but significant increase in subjective quality rating as stimulation rates increased from 1200 to 2400 ppse in noise. Consistent with previous studies, performance significantly improved as the number of electrodes was increased from 4 to 8, but no significant difference showed between 8, 12 and 16 electrodes. Altogether, there was little-to-no advantage of high stimulation rates in quiet or in noise, at least for the present speech tests and conditions. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Experiment 1 measured phoneme recognition as a function of stimulation rate in six Nucleus-22 cochlear implant listeners using an experimental four-channel continuous interleaved sampler (CIS) speech processing strategy. Results showed that all stimulation rates from 150 to 500 pulses/s/electrode produced equally good performance, while stimulation rates lower than 150 pulses/s/electrode produced significantly poorer performance. Experiment 2 measured phoneme recognition by implant listeners and normal-hearing listeners as a function of the low-pass cutoff frequency for envelope information. Results from both acoustic and electric hearing showed no significant difference in performance for all cutoff frequencies higher than 20 Hz. Both vowel and consonant scores dropped significantly when the cutoff frequency was reduced from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The results of these two experiments suggest that temporal envelope information can be conveyed by relatively low stimulation rates. The pattern of results for both electrical and acoustic hearing is consistent with a simple model of temporal integration with an equivalent rectangular duration (ERD) of the temporal integrator of about 7 ms.},

This would validate the use of such vocoders as acoustic models of CIs. We further hypothesize that those valid acoustic models will require a personalized amount of frequency mismatch between input filters and output tones or noise bands. BACKGROUND: Noise or tone vocoders have been used as acoustic models of CIs in hundreds of publications but have never been convincingly validated. METHODS: Acoustic models were evaluated by single-sided deaf CI users who compared what they heard with the CI in one ear to what they heard with the acoustic model in the other ear. We evaluated frequency-matched models (both all-channel and 6-channel models, both tone and noise vocoders) as well as self-selected models that included an individualized level of frequency mismatch. RESULTS: Self-selected acoustic models resulted in similar levels of speech perception and similar perceptual quality as the CI. These models also matched the CI in terms of perceived intelligibility, harshness, and pleasantness. CONCLUSION: Valid acoustic models of CIs exist, but they are different from the models most widely used in the literature. Individual amounts of frequency mismatch may be required to optimize the validity of the model. This may be related to the basalward frequency mismatch experienced by postlingually deaf patients after cochlear implantation.},

	abstract = {A novel psychophysical method was developed for assessing spatial resolution in cochlear implants. Spectrally flat and spectrally peaked pulse train stimuli were generated by interleaving pulses on 11 electrodes. Spectrally flat stimuli used loudness-balanced currents and the spectrally peaked stimuli had a single spatial ripple with the current of the middle electrode raised to create a peak while the currents on two electrodes equally spaced at variable distance from the peak electrode were reduced to create valleys. The currents on peak and valley electrodeswere adjusted to balance the overall loudness with the spectrally flat stimulus, while keeping the currents on flanking electrodes fixed. The psychometric functions obtained from percent correct discrimination of peaked and flat stimuli versus the distance between peak and valley electrodes were used to quantify spatial resolution for each of the eight subjects. Theability to resolve the spatial ripple correlated strongly with current level difference limens measured on thepeak electrode. The results were consistent with ahypothesis that a factor other than spread of excitation (such as neural response variance) might underlie much of the variability in spatial resolution. Resolution ability was not correlated with phoneme recognition in quiet or sentence recognition in quiet and background noise, consistent with a hypothesis that implantees rely on cues other than fine spectral detail to identify speech, perhaps because this detail is poorly accessible or unreliable. © 2011 Association for Research in Otolaryngology.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims—Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional risk factors predict 75-80\% of an individual's risk of incident CVD. However, the role of early life experiences in future disease risk is gaining attention. The Barker hypothesis proposes fetal origins of adult disease, with consistent evidence demonstrating the deleterious consequences of birth weight outside the normal range. In this study, we investigate the role of birth weight in CVD risk prediction. Methods and Results—The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) represents a large national cohort of post-menopausal women with 63 815 participants included in this analysis. Univariable proportional hazards regression analyses evaluated the association of 4 self-reported birth weight categories against 3 CVD outcome definitions, which included indicators of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, carotid artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. The role of birth weight was also evaluated for prediction of CVD events in the presence of traditional risk factors using 3 existing CVD risk prediction equations: one body mass index (BMI)-based and two laboratory-based models. Low birth weight (LBW) ({\textless} 6 lbs.) was significantly associated with all CVD outcome definitions in univariable analyses (HR=1.086, p=0.009). LBW was a significant covariate in the BMI-based model (HR=1.128, p{\textless}0.0001) but not in the lipid-based models. Conclusion—LBW ({\textless}6 lbs.) is independently associated with CVD outcomes in the WHI cohort. This finding supports the role of the prenatal and postnatal environment in contributing to the development of adult chronic disease.},

	abstract = {Stimulation pulse rate affects current amplitude discrimination by cochlear implant (CI) users, indicated by the evidence that the JND (just noticeable difference) in current amplitude delivered by a CI electrode becomes larger at higher pulse rates. However, it is not clearly understood whether pulse rate would affect discrimination of speech intensities presented acoustically to CI processors, or what the size of this effect might be. Intensity discrimination depends on two factors: the growth of loudness with increasing sound intensity and the loudness JND (or the just noticeable loudness increment). This study evaluated the hypothesis that stimulation pulse rate affects loudness JND. This was done by measuring current amplitude JNDs in an experiment design based on signal detection theory according to which loudness discrimination is related to internal noise (which is manifested by variability in loudness percept in response to repetitions of the same physical stimulus). Current amplitude JNDs were measured for equally loud pulse trains of 500 and 3000 pps (pulses per second) by increasing the current amplitude of the target pulse train until it was perceived just louder than a same-rate or different-rate reference pulse train. The JND measures were obtained at two presentation levels. At the louder level, the current amplitude JNDs were affected by the rate of the reference pulse train in a way that was consistent with greater noise or variability in loudness perception for the higher pulse rate. The results suggest that increasing pulse rate from 500 to 3000 pps can increase loudness JND by 60 \% at the upper portion of the dynamic range. This is equivalent to a 38 \% reduction in the number of discriminable steps for acoustic and speech intensities.},

In order to determine BHLHB5’s functional mechanism in retinogenesis, we used the Cre-loxP recombination system to genetically trace the lineage of BHLHB5+ cells in normal and Bhlhb5-null retinas. The Bhlhb5-Cre knock-in allele was used to activate the constitutive expression of a GFP reporter in the Bhlhb5-expressing cells, and the cell fates of Bhlhb5-lineage cells were identified by using specific cell markers and were compared between normal and Bhlhb5-null retinas. Results—In addition to GABAergic amacrine and OFF-CB cells, Bhlhb5 lineage cells give rise to ganglion, glycinergic amacrine, rod bipolar, ON-bipolar, and rod photoreceptor cells during normal retinal development. Targeted deletion of Bhlhb5 resulted in the loss of GABAergic amacrine, glycinergic amacrine, dopaminergic amacrine, and Type 2 OFF-CB cells. Furthermore, in the absence of BHLHB5, a portion of Bhlhb5 lineage cells switch their fate and differentiate into cholinergic amacrine cells. Conclusions—Our data reveal a broad expression pattern of Bhlhb5 throughout retinogenesis and demonstrate the cell-autonomous as well as non-cell-autonomous role of Bhlhb5 in the specification of amacrine and bipolar subtypes.},

	abstract = {Object. Development of multichannel auditory brainstem implant (ABI) systems has been based in part on the assumption that audiological outcome can be optimized by increasing the number of available electrodes. In this paper the authors critically analyze this assumption on the basis of a retrospective clinical study performed using the Nucleus 22 ABI surface electrode array. Methods. The perceptual performances of 61 patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2 were tested approximately 6 weeks after an eight-electrode ABI had been implanted. Of eight implanted electrodes 5.57 ± 2.57 (mean ± standard deviation [SD] provided auditory sensations when stimulated. Electrodes were deactivated when stimulation resulted in significant nonauditory side effects or no auditory sensation at all, and also when they failed to provide distinctive pitch sensations. The mean (± SD) scores for patients with ABIs were the following: sound-only consonant recognition, 20.4 ± 14.3 (range 0-65\%); vowel recognition, 28.8 ± 18\% (range 0-67\%); Monosyllable Trochee Spondee (MTS) word recognition 41.1 ± 25.3\% (range 0-100\%); and sentence recognition, 5.3 ± 11.4\% (range 0-64\%). Performance in patients in whom between one and three electrodes provided auditory sensation was significantly poorer than that in patients with between four and eight functional electrodes in the vowel, MTS word, and City University of New York (CUNY) sentence recognition tests. The correlation between performance and electrode number did not reach the 0.05 level of significance with respect to the sound effect, consonant, and MTS stress-pattern recognition tests, probably because a satisfactory performance in these tests can be obtained only with temporal cues, that is, without any information about the frequency of the sounds. In the MTS word and the CUNY sentence recognition tests, performance was optimal in the patients with eight functional electrodes. Although all top performers had more than three functional auditory electrodes, no further improvement (asymptotic performance) was seen in those with five or more active electrodes in the consonant, vowel, and sound effect recognition tests. Conclusions. A minimum of three spectral channels, programmed in the appropriate individual tonotopic order seem to be required for satisfactory speech recognition in most patients with ABI. Due to the limited access to the tonotopic frequency gradient of the cochlear nucleus with surface stimulation, patients with ABI do not receive a wide range of spectral cues (frequency information) with multielectrode ({\textgreater} 5) surface arrays.},

	abstract = {Poor sensitivity to the interaural time difference (ITD) constrains the ability of human bilateral cochlear implant users to listen in everyday noisy acoustic environments. ITD sensitivity to periodic pulse trains degrades sharply with increasing pulse rate but can be restored at high pulse rates by jittering the interpulse intervals in a binaurally coherent manner (Laback and Majdak. Binaural jitter improves interaural time-difference sensitivity of cochlear implantees at high pulse rates. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105: 814 817, 2008). We investigated the neural basis of the jitter effect by recording from single inferior colliculus (IC) neurons in bilaterally implanted, anesthetized cats. Neural responses to trains of biphasic pulses were measured as a function of pulse rate, jitter, and ITD. An effect of jitter on neural responses was most prominent for pulse rates above 300 pulses/s. High-rate periodic trains evoked only an onset response in most IC neurons, but introducing jitter increased ongoing firing rates in about half of these neurons. Neurons that had sustained responses to jittered high-rate pulse trains showed ITD tuning comparable with that produced by low-rate periodic pulse trains. Thus, jitter appears to improve neural ITD sensitivity by restoring sustained firing in many IC neurons. The effect of jitter on IC responses is qualitatively consistent with human psychophysics. Action potentials tended to occur reproducibly at sparse, preferred times across repeated presentations of high-rate jittered pulse trains. Spike triggered averaging of responses to jittered pulse trains revealed that firing was triggered by very short interpulse intervals. This suggests it may be possible to restore ITD sensitivity to periodic carriers by simply inserting short interpulse intervals at select times. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

Setting: Tertiary referral centre. Patients: Implanted with a Cochlear ABI22 or ABI24M between 1994 and 2009 because of NF2 disease. Intervention(s): Rehabilitative. Main Outcome Measure(s): Surgical complication rate; audiological outcomes. Results: There were 50 primary ABI insertions in 49 patients, including 16 inserted at the time of first side tumor removal as a sleeper, and two revision repositionings which failed to improve outcome. Postoperatively three patients had cerebrospinal fluid leaks which did not require reoperation, one patient had meningitis, and eleven patients suffered either temporary or permanent lower cranial nerve dysfunction. Twenty-nine patients became full time users; a further 12 patients became non-users. Three patients died while their device was inactive. Five patients retain serviceable contralateral hearing. Audiological open set testing of users showed means of: environmental sounds discrimination 51\%; phoneme discrimination: with ABI alone 22\%/lip reading (LR) 45\%/ABI with LR 65\%; sentence testing: with ABI alone 13\%/LR 19\%/ABI with LR 54\%. Conclusions: The majority of patients with NF2 implanted with an ABI find the device a useful aid to communication in conjunction with LR and in recognizing common environmental sounds. A small proportion gain open set discrimination. Almost a third of patients may end up as non-users. There is probably an increased risk of postoperative lower cranial nerve dysfunction so careful preoperative assessment is advised.},

	abstract = {Persons who lack an auditory nerve cannot benefit from cochlear implants, but a prosthesis utilizing an electrode array implanted on the surface of the cochlear nucleus can restore some hearing. Worldwide, more than 500 persons have received these "auditory brainstem implants," most commonly after removal of the tumors that occur with Type 2 Neurofibromatosis (NF2). Typically, the ABIs provide these individuals with improved speech perception when combined with lip-reading and useful perception of environmental sounds, but little open-set speech recognition. The feasibility of supplementing the array of surface electrodes with penetrating microstimulating electrodes has been investigated in animal studies, and 10 persons with NF2 have received implants that include a surface array and an array of penetrating microelectrodes. Their speech perception is not significantly better than that of the NF2 patients who have only the surface arrays, but the findings do validate the concept of intranuclear stimulation and suggest how such prostheses might be improved by modifying the microstimulating array and also by optimizing the sound processing strategies. Recent publications have described ABI patients with deafness of etiologies other than NF2 who have achieved open-set speech recognition. This suggests that the cochlear nuclei of the NF2 patients are damaged by the disease process or during surgical removal of the tumor. © 2007.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have considered only patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) older than 12 years as candidates for an auditory brainstem implant (ABI). Our study expands the potential criteria to include both children and adult subjects with other cochlear or cochlear nerve malfunctions who either would not benefit at all from a cochlear implant (eg, cochlear nerve aplasia or avulsion) or whose benefit was or would be severely compromised (eg, cochlear ossification, cochlear fracture). STUDY DESIGN: In our department, over the period from April 1997 to September 2002, 29 patients, 20 adults and 9 children, were fitted with ABIs. Their ages ranged from 14 months to 70 years. Thirteen subjects had tumors, 10 NF2 and 3 solitary vestibular schwannoma, and 16 patients had a variety of nontumor (NT) cochlear or cochlear nerve diseases. A retrosigmoid-transmeatal approach was used in T and a retrosigmoid approach in NT patients. The electrode array was inserted into the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle and correct electrode positioning was monitored with the aid of electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs). RESULTS: Correct implantation was achieved in all patients. No complications were observed due to implantation surgery or related to ABI activation or long-term use. Auditory sensations were induced in all patients with various numbers of electrodes (from 5 to 15). Different pitch sensations were identifiable with different electrode stimulation. Closed-set word recognition, open-set sentence recognition, and speech tracking scores achieved by the patients are reported in detail. The auditory performance of the patients showed significantly better outcomes than controls (Multicentric European clinical investigations on ABI with NF2). CONCLUSION: We have shown that the indications for the ABI can be extended to include NT patients with severe cochlear and/or cochlear nerve abnormalities. The degree of auditory benefit varies as a function of the underlying pathological conditions, with NT subjects exhibiting significantly better outcomes than the T patients. © 2005 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc.

	abstract = {Although pitch is closely related to temporal periodicity, stimuli with a degree of temporal irregularity can evoke a pitch sensation in human listeners. However, the neural mechanisms underlying pitch perception for irregular sounds are poorly understood. Here, we recorded responses of single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of normal hearing (NH) rabbits to acoustic pulse trains with different amounts of random jitter in the inter-pulse intervals and compared with responses to electric pulse trains delivered through a cochlear implant (CI) in a different group of rabbits. In both NH and CI animals, many IC neurons demonstrated tuning of firing rate to the average pulse rate (APR) that was robust against temporal jitter, although jitter tended to increase the firing rates for APRs ≥ 1280 Hz. Strength and limiting frequency of spike synchronization to stimulus pulses were also comparable between periodic and irregular pulse trains, although there was a slight increase in synchronization at high APRs with CI stimulation. There were clear differences between CI and NH animals in both the range of APRs over which firing rate tuning was observed and the prevalence of synchronized responses. These results suggest that the pitches of regular and irregular pulse trains are coded differently by IC neurons depending on the APR, the degree of irregularity, and the mode of stimulation. In particular, the temporal pitch produced by periodic pulse trains lacking spectral cues may be based on a rate code rather than a temporal code at higher APRs.},

However, little is known about the properties of electrically induced responses in the hearing cochlea. In the present study, normal-hearing guinea pig cochleae underwent cochlear implantation through a cochleostomy without significant loss of hearing. Using recordings of unit activity in the midbrain, we were able to investigate the excitation patterns throughout the tonotopic field determined by acoustic stimulation. With the cochlear implant and the midbrain multielectrode arrays left in place, the ears were pharmacologically deafened and electrical stimulation was repeated in the deafened condition. The results demonstrate that, in addition to direct neuronal (electroneuronal) stimulation, in the hearing cochlea excitation of the hair cells occurs (“electrophonic responses”) at the cochlear site corresponding to the dominant temporal frequency components of the electrical stimulus, provided these are {\textless}12 kHz. The slope of the rate–level functions of the neurons in the deafened condition was steeper and the firing rate was higher than in the hearing condition at those sites that were activated in the two conditions. Finally, in a monopolar stimulation configuration, the differences between hearing status conditions were smaller than in the narrower (bipolar) configurations.},

Background: Advantages to be expected of a perimodiolar electrode array include both a reduction in stimulus thresholds and an increase in dynamic range, resulting in a more localized stimulation pattern of the spiral ganglion cells, reduced power consumption, and, therefore, longer speech processor battery life. Methods: The test arrays were implanted into human temporal bones. Image analysis was performed on a radiograph taken after the insertion. The cochleas were then histologically processed with the electrode array in situ, and the resulting sections were subsequently assessed for position of the electrode array as well as insertion-related intracochlear damage. Results: All perimodiolar electrode arrays were inserted deeper and showed trajectories that were generally closer to the modiolus compared with the standard electrode array. However, although the precurved array designs did not show significant insertion trauma, the method of insertion needed improvement. After insertion of the straight electrode array with positioner, signs of severe insertion trauma in the majority of implanted cochleas were found. Conclusions: Although it was possible to position the electrode arrays close to the modiolus, none of the three perimodiolar designs investigated fulfilled satisfactorily all three criteria of being easy, safe, and atraumatic to implant.},

	abstract = {In this viewpoint article, we discuss the electric properties of the medium around neurons, which are important to correctly interpret extracellular potentials or electric field effects in neural tissue. We focus on how these electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as 1/?f, which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological conditions. Ionic diffusion appears to be the only possible explanation to reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed by shunt currents going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a framework where all observations can be reconciled. Finally, we propose a method to perform measurements avoiding shunting effects, thus enabling to test the predictions of this framework.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Multichannel auditory brainstem implants (ABI) are currently indicated for patients with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) and schwannomas involving the internal auditory canal (IAC) or cerebellopontine angle (CPA), regardless of hearing loss (HL). The implant is usually placed in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle at the time of tumor resection to stimulate the cochlear nucleus. This study aims to review the surgical and audiologic outcomes in 18 patients implanted by our Skull Base Surgery Team from 1994 through 2003. Study Design: A retrospective chart review of 18 patients with ABIs. Methods: We evaluated demographic data including age at implantation, number of tumor resections before implantation, tumor size, surgical approach, and postoperative surgical complications. The ABI auditory results at 1 year were then evaluated for number of functioning electrodes and channels, hours per day of use, nonauditory side effect profile and hearing results. Audiologic data including Monosyllable, Spondee, Trochee test (MTS) Word and Stress scores, Northwestern University Children's Perception of Speech (NU-CHIPS), and auditory sensitivity are reported. Results: No surgical complications caused by ABI implantation were revealed. A probe for lateral recess and cochlear nucleus localization was helpful in several patients. A range of auditory performance is reported, and two patients had no auditory perceptions. Electrode paddle migration occurred in two patients. Patient education and encouragement is very important to obtain maximum benefit. Conclusions: ABIs are safe, do not increase surgical morbidity, and allow most patients to experience improved communication as well as access to environmental sounds. Nonauditory side effects can be minimized by selecting proper stimulation patterns. The ABI continues to be an emerging field for hearing rehabilitation in patients who are deafened by NF2.},

	abstract = {Optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dye was used to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of stimulus-driven activity on the surface of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Stimulation with tones at low to moderate levels produced localized regions of activation that were most commonly elongated rostrocaudally. The size of these activation areas expanded with increases in sound level, while their centers shifted from the lateral direction to the medial direction with increases in stimulus frequency. In contrast to the tonotopic patterns of activation evoked by tones, electrical stimulation of the DCN surface resulted in bands of activation that were elongated along the medial-lateral axis; response latencies increased with distance along these bands from the point of stimulation. Shifting the site of electrical stimulation from the rostral direction to the caudal direction induced corresponding shifts in the rostrocaudal location of the activation band; moving the electrode tip to subsurface depths resulted in loss of the elongated band. Transecting the DCN along the rostrocaudal axis midway between its medial and lateral extremities blocked propagation of the response to the half of the DCN distal to but not proximal to the stimulating electrode. The results suggest that the two modes of stimulation activated two distinct populations of neurons, one involving primarily tonotopically organized cells and the other crossing these tonotopic zones and likely representing the activation of parallel fibers. These results reveal a number of new features in the spatial patterns of tone-elicited activation that are not readily predicted by responses recorded electrophysiologically. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Despite its critical importance in experimental and clinical neuroscience, at present there is no systematic method to predict which neural elements will be activated by a given stimulation regime. Here we develop a novel approach to model the effect of cortical stimulation on spiking probability of neurons in a volume of tissue, by applying an analytical estimate of stimulation-induced activation of different cell types across cortical layers. We utilize the morphology and properties of axonal arborization profiles obtained from publicly available anatomical reconstructions of the twelve main categories of neocortical neurons to derive the dependence of activation probability on cell type, layer and distance from the source. We then propagate this activity through the local network incorporating connectivity, synaptic and cellular properties. Our work predicts that (a) intracranial cortical stimulation induces selective activation across cell types and layers; (b) superficial anodal stimulation is more effective than cathodal at cell activation; (c) cortical surface stimulation focally activates layer I axons, and (d) there is an optimal stimulation intensity capable of eliciting cell activation lasting beyond the end of stimulation. We conclude that selective effects of cortical electrical stimulation across cell types and cortical layers are largely driven by their different axonal arborization and myelination profiles.},

	doi = {10.3171/jns.2002.97.6.1367},
	abstract = {Object. Laboratory training models are essential for developing and refining surgical skills, especially for microsurgery. The closer to live surgery the model is, the greater the benefit. In this paper the authors introduce a cadaver model with unique characteristics: dynamic filling of the cerebral vasculature with colored liquid and clear fluid filling of the arachnoid cisterns. This model is distinctive and has great practical value for training in a wide range of surgical procedures. Methods. Cadaveric heads were prepared for surgical procedures in the following manner: the carotid arteries (CAs) and vertebral arteries (VAs) in the neck were cannulated, as were the internal jugular veins (JVs) on both sides. Two tubes were introduced into the spinal canal and each one was advanced into one of the cerebellopontine angle cisterns. A CA, VA, or both were then connected to a reservoir containing light red fluid and a pressure of 80 to 120 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 60 beats/minute were established using a pump. The JV on the side currently being dissected was connected to a reservoir containing dark red fluid and kept at a pressure between 20 and 40 mm Hg. The remaining vessels were clamped in the neck. The cisternal tubes were connected to a reservoir of clear fluid that was regulated by an adjustable flow. Nine trainees have tested this model on eight specimens by practicing a variety of surgical procedures and maneuvers, including craniotomies; hemostasis; cisternal and vascular dissection; vascular anastomosis and repair; establishment of arterial bypasses; aneurysm creation, dissection, and clipping; management of an aneurysm rupture; intraparenchymal resection such as amygdalohippocampectomy; ventricular endoscopy and third ventriculostomy; cavernous sinus and skull base approaches; and resection of artificial tumors in the basal cisterns. Conclusions. This model mimics the normal human anatomy and dynamic vascular filling found in real surgery and presents it from the training perspective, allowing a wide range of skill development and repeated practice. It provides an alternative model to laboratory animals. It is inexpensive and readily available, and has great value for the acquisition and refinement of surgical skills that are not only specific to neurosurgery, but are applicable to other surgical disciplines.},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study; a systematic review of the literature in PubMed was also performed to identify all published cases of bilateral TB fractures or bilateral deafness after head trauma treated by means of CI or ABI. SETTINGS: Quaternary otology and skull base surgery referral center. PATIENTS: Eleven consecutive patients presented with bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss after head trauma. INTERVENTIONS: CI as primary intervention or following a previous treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CI performances were evaluated in the auditory-only condition in both closed-set and open-set formats. RESULTS: Fourteen CI were placed, 11 as primary treatment and 3 after ABI failure. At the last follow-up, all patients gained useful open-set speech perception. In secondary CI, all patients obtained better auditory results with the CI if compared with ABI. CI performance did not decrease with time in any case. CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation after TB fractures has proved to have excellent audiometric results. The aim of the initial evaluation of a patient with bilateral anacoustic ears from head trauma should always be to rehabilitate their hearing with a CI. The incidence of labyrinthitis ossificans, negative electrophysiologic testing, the risk of postoperative meningitis or facial nerve stimulation should not be the determinant factors that favor ABI placement.

	abstract = {1. The topographical distributions of single-unit and multiple-unit responses to amplitude-modulated tones - and to other relevant parameters of simple tonal stimuli - were defined across the main frequency representational gradient and within narrow frequency ranges represented in 'frequency band laminae' in the principal midbrain auditory nucleus, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC), in adult, barbiturate-anesthetized cats. 2. Responses to amplitude-modulated tones with the carrier set at the characteristic frequency (CF) of recorded neurons were obtained at many ICC locations in each experiment. The best modulation frequency (BMF) of neurons was defined at each site as that modulation frequency producing the highest neural discharge rate. Encountered BMFs ranged from {\textasciitilde}10 to 1,000 Hz. A significant range of BMFs were recorded for neurons with any given characteristic frequency. BMF ranges varied as a systematic function of CF and of ICC recording depth. 3. Recorded BMFs were distributed topographically within functionally defined ICC frequency band laminae. Highest BMFs were found clustered in an ICC sector roughly between the middle and lateral third of its frequency band laminae. Progressively lower BMFs were recorded with increasing distance across the laminae in any direction away from the highest-BMF cluster. That is, 'iso-BMF contours' were arrayed concentrically around the highest-BMF region. 4. Within the frequency band laminae centered at {\textasciitilde}3 and 12 kHz, quality factors (Q(10 dB)S) of frequency tuning curves were found to be between 0.8 and 8. Q(10 dB) values were distributed topographically within given frequency band laminae. Responses with narrow tuning curves (high Q(10 dB) values) were clustered in the middle third of the mediolateral extent of laminae; sharpness of tuning declined systematically away from this focus of highest Q(10 dB) values. The center of this distribution did not coincide with the center of the BMF distribution within the same lamina. 5. For neurons at {\textgreater}90\% of the ICC loci studied in these experiments, onset latencies to CF tones defined {\textasciitilde}60 dB above response threshold fell within a range between 5 and 18 ms. Across a given frequency band lamina, onset latencies varied systematically, with longest response latencies recorded medially, and progressively shorter latencies recorded progressively more laterally. 6. Binaural interaction types were systematically distributed within frequency-band laminae. A cluster of excitatory-excitatory (EE) was seen, covering approximately one-third of the mapped area. The remaining area contained predominantly neurons with monaurally excitatory (EO) input and a few single locations or small clusters (3-4 locations) of excitatory-inhibitory (EI) neurons. 7. It is concluded that in addition to the long-described 'tonotopic' (or 'cochleotopic') representations within the ICC, other response characteristics (best modulation frequencies for amplitude-modulated tones, onset latencies to tones, sharpness of frequency tuning curves, binaural interaction type) are also represented topographically within this principal midbrain auditory nucleus. These and other data collected in this series of experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the orderly representations of BMFs constitute a topographic representation of periodicity information related to the percept of periodicity pitch.},

	abstract = {The precedence effect (PE) describes an illusion produced when two similar sounds are delivered in quick succession (interclick delays of 2-8 msec) from sound sources at different locations so that only a single sound is perceived. The localization of the perceived sound is dominated by the location of the leading sound. If the delays are very short ({\textless}1-2 msec), summing localization occurs and a phantom source is perceived whose location is toward the leading sound. The purpose of these experiments was to look for physiological correlates of the precedence effect and summing localization by recording from single neurons in the inferior colliculus of the anesthetized cat. Click stimuli were delivered under two different situations: over headphones in dichotic experiments and through two speakers in an anechoic room in free-field studies. In the latter case the cat was placed midway between the speakers and a single click stimulus was delivered to each speaker with variable interclick delays (ICDs). Most cells, under both dichotic and free-field conditions, exhibited a form of the precedence effect in which the response to the lagging click was suppressed when ICDs were short. The suppression of the lagging click, or echo, was measured by recovery curves, which plotted the response of the lagging click as a function of ICD. There was considerable variability in the recovery curves from different cells: the ICDs at which the recovery reached 50\%, which is a measure of the echo threshold for the cell, ranged from 1 to 100 msec with a median of 20 msec. Human psychophysical experiments report echo thresholds for clicks ranging from 2 to 8 msec. If we assume that absolute echo threshold is determined by the cells with shortest recovery curves, then the thresholds for single cells are in accord with the psychophysical results. The possible sites of generation of the echo suppression are also considered. Changes in the relative level of the leading and lagging clicks produced the expected shifts in the recovery curves. With short ICDs in the summing localization range (between about ±2 msec), cells also showed responses consonant with the human psychophysical result that the sound source is localized to a phantom image between the two speakers and toward the leading one. The location of the image varied systematically with the relative levels or ICDs of the clicks. These results suggest that the neural substrate for many of the psychophysical effects of the PE and summing localization are seen at the level of the ICC and therefore lend support to the two basic assumptions: that the cat also experiences the PE and that the discharge of at least some cells in the ICC is related to the perceived location of the sound source.},

	abstract = {We examined how well single neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of an FM bat (Myotis lucifugus) processed simple tone bursts of different duration and sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) signals that approximated passively heard natural sounds. Units' responses to SAM tones, measured in terms of average spike count and firing synchrony to the modulation envelope, were plotted as a function of the modulation frequency to construct their modulation transfer functions. These functions were classified according to their shape (e.g., band-, low-, high-, and all-pass). IC neurons having different temporal firing patterns to simple tone bursts (tonic, chopper, onset-late, and onset-immediate) exhibited different selectivities for SAM signals. All tonic and 83\% of chopper neurons responded robustly to SAM signals and displayed a variety of spike count-based response functions. These neurons showed a decreased level of time-locking as the modulation frequency was increased, and thereby gave low-pass synchronization-based response functions. In contrast, 64\% of onset-immediate, 37\% of onset-late and 17\% of chopper units failed to respond to SAM signals at any modulation frequency tested (5-800 Hz). Those onset neurons that did respond to SAM showed poor time-locking (i.e.. non-significant levels of synchronization). We obtained evidence that the poor SAM response of some onset and chopper neurons was due to a preference for short-duration signals. These data suggest that tonic and most chopper neurons are better-suited for the processing of long-duration SAM signals related to passive hearing, whereas onset neurons are better-suited for the processing of short, pulsatile signals such as those used in echolocation.},

Intracellular recording in situ allows direct examination of synaptic inputs to the IC in response to acoustic stimulation. Using this technique and monaural or binaural stimulation, responses in the IC that reflect input from a lower center can be distinguished from responses that reflect synaptic integration within the IC. Our results indicate that many IC neurons receive synaptic inputs from multiple sources. Few, if any, IC neurons acted as simple relay cells. Responses often displayed complex interactions between excitatory and inhibitory sources, such that different synaptic mechanisms could underlie similar response patterns. Thus, it may be an oversimplification to classify the responses of IC neurons as simply excitatory or inhibitory, as is done in many studies. In addition, inhibition and intrinsic membrane properties appeared to play key roles in creating de hove temporal response patterns in the IC.},

	abstract = {The spike discharge regularity of 254 tonically firing units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the anesthetized guinea pig was studied in response to tones presented at best frequency (BF) to the ear contralateral to the recorded IC. Regularity of firing was measured by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) as a function of time over the course of a unit's response. Two hundred and fifteen units (56 under urethan and 159 under chloralose anesthesia) in the central nucleus of the IC (CNIC) were studied in detail. In response to tones at 15-25 dB above threshold, 80\% of units in the urethan sample fired regularly (CV {\textless} 0.5) during their sustained response, and 46\% were highly regular (CV ≤ 0.35). For chloralose the values were 68\% and 23\%, respectively. Units recorded under urethan were significantly more regular than those recorded under chloralose. For units in the sample with a measurable onset CV, 63\% were regular and 44\% highly regular under urethan, and 73\% were regular and 54\% highly regular under chloralose. The units' peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) patterns were classified into subdivisions of four categories: choppers [9\%: chop-sustained (C(s)), chop-onset (C(o))]; pausers [42\%: pauser-chop-sustained (P/C(s)), pauser-chop-onset (P/C(o)), pauser-no-chop]; ON-sustained (43\%: primary- type, L-type, h-type); and sustained (6\%). The presence of chopping was a reliable predictor of regularity: C(s) and P/C(s) units were highly regular throughout their response, whereas C(o) and P/C(o) units were highly regular at onset and became less regular. Some units in the other PSTH categories were highly regular despite the absence of chopping, and units with virtually identical PSTHs showed very different sustained CVs. Regularity was measured as a function of firing rate in 71 units. In 23\%, regularity remained constant when firing rate changed with stimulus level. Forty-six percent fired more regularly as firing rate increased, 8\% fired less regularly, and 23\% of units showed no consistent relationship between CV and firing rate. Regularity did not correlate with the neurons' frequency response areas or BFs. Regular firing was also found in a smaller sample of units recorded in cortices surrounding the CNIC. We conclude that regular firing is a characteristic feature of most neurons in the IC. Regularity is a specific feature correlated with four PSTH types (C(s), C(o), P/C(s), and P/C(o)). Other PSTH types may or may not exhibit regularity.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to establish the young adult (3 month) Fischer 344 (F344) rat as a model of inferior colliculus (IC) physiology, providing a baseline for analysis of changes in single unit responses as the animals age and for the study of noise induced hearing loss. The response properties of units localized to the central nucleus of the IC (CIC) and those localized to the external cortex of the IC (ECIC) were compared in order to better characterize differences between these two subnuclei in the processing of simple auditory stimuli. In vivo extracellular single unit recordings were made from IC neurons in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized young adult F344 rats. When a unit was electrically isolated, the spontaneous activity level, characteristic frequency (CF) and CF threshold were determined. Rate/intensity functions (RIFs) in response to contralateral CF tones and to contralateral noise bursts were obtained as were tone isointensity functions. The recording site was marked by ejecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from an electrode. Locations of recorded units were determined from electrode track marks and HRP marks in serial brain sections. Recordings were made from 320 neurons in the IC; 176 were localized to the CIC and 87 to the ECIC. Thirteen percent of the units in each subdivision were found to be poorly responsive to auditory stimulation (clicks, tones or noise), and spontaneous activity was generally low. Characteristic frequencies representative of the full rat audiogram were found in each subdivision with the mean threshold significantly higher in the ECIC (28.7 dB SPL) than in the CIC (22.3 dB SPL). The mean maximum discharge rate to CF tone bursts was near 24 spikes/s in each subdivision. Dynamic range tended to be higher in the ECIC (28.3 dB) than in the CIC (23.2 dB), reflecting the lower percentage of nonmonotonic units found in the ECIC. Most units responded more robustly with a slower tone presentation rate, displayed lower levels of discharge to noise bursts than to tone bursts, and had differently shaped tone and noise RIFs. Most units were classified as onset responders to CF tone bursts in both subdivisions, with the percentage of onset responders higher in the ECIC (68.9\%) than in the CIC (57.8\%). First spike latency did not differ significantly between the subdivisions, but tended to be shorter in the CIC. The breadth of the excitatory receptive fields did not differ significantly between subdivisions, although the mean was slightly larger in the ECIC. These results are generally consistent with the results of CIC studies from other species, establishing the F344 rat as a model of CIC physiology. Differences between CIC and ECIC units included a higher percentage of nonmonotonic RIFs and lower percentage of onset temporal response patterns in the CIC than in the ECIC. Some properties which have been previously used as hallmarks for differentiation between CIC and ECIC units, namely broader tuning and longer first spike latencies in the ECIC, did not reach statistical significance in this study. These may reflect species differences and/or the highly variable and largely overlapping sets of responses evident in the large sample size used in this study.},

	abstract = {Several auditory spatial illusions, collectively called the precedence effect (PE), occur when transient sounds are presented from two different spatial locations but separated in time by an interstimulus delay (ISD). For ISDs in the range of localization dominance ({\textless}10 ms), a single fused sound is typically located near the leading source location only, as if the location of the lagging source were suppressed. For longer ISDs, both the leading and lagging sources can be heard and localized, and the shortest ISD where this occurs is called the echo threshold. Previous physiological studies of the extracellular responses of single neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of anesthetized cats and unanesthetized rabbits with sounds known to elicit the PE have shown correlates of these phenomena though there were differences in the physiologically measured echo thresholds. Here we recorded in the IC of awake, behaving cats using stimuli that we have shown to evoke behavioral responses that are consistent with the precedence effect. For small ISDs, responses to the lag were reduced or eliminated consistent with psychophysical data showing that sound localization is based on the leading source. At longer ISDs, the responses to the lagging source recovered at ISDs comparable to psychophysically measured echo thresholds. Thus it appears that anesthesia, and not species differences, accounts for the discrepancies in the earlier studies.},

	abstract = {The precedence effect (PE) is thought to be beneficial for proper localization and perception of sounds. The majority of recent physiological studies focus on the neural discharges correlated with PE in the inferior colliculus (IC). Pentobarbital anesthesia is widely used in physiological studies. However, little is known of the effect of pentobarbital on the discharge of neurons in PE. Neuronal responses in the IC from 23 male SD rats were recorded by standard extracellular recording techniques following presentation of 4. ms white noise bursts, presented from either or both of two loud speakers, at different interstimulus delays (ISDs). The neural responses were recorded for off-line analysis before or after intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital at a loading or maintenance dose. Data were assessed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons. When the ipsilateral stimuli were leading, pentobarbital at a loading dose significantly increased normalized response to lagging stimuli during recovery from anesthesia. However, it was not the case when the contralateral stimuli were leading. At a maintenance dose, the normalized response to lagging stimuli were significantly reduced, independent of whether contralateral or ipsilateral stimuli were leading. These data show that pentobarbital have no effect on the normalized response of leading stimuli but can prolong the recovery time of lagging stimuli to paired sources produced PE illusions, which was gradually attenuated during recovery from anesthesia. Thus, extracellular recording immediately after administration of pentobarbital should be avoided in physiological studies of neural correlates of PE. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Spike sorting is an essential first step in most analyses of extracellular in vivo electrophysiological recordings. Here we show that spike-sorting success depends critically on characteristics of coordinated population activity that can differ between anesthetic states. In tetrode recordings from mouse auditory cortex, spike sorting was significantly less successful under ketamine/medetomidine (ket/med) than urethane anesthesia. Surprisingly, this difficulty with sorting under ket/med anesthesia did not appear to result from either greater millisecond-scale burstiness of neural activity or increased coordination of activity among neighboring neurons. Rather, the key factor affecting sorting success appeared to be the amount of coordinated population activity at long time intervals and across large cortical distances. We propose that spike-sorting success is directly dependent on overall coordination of activity, and is most disrupted by large-scale fluctuations in cortical population activity. Reliability of single-unit recording may therefore differ not only between urethane-anesthetized and ket/med-anesthetized states as demonstrated here, but also between synchronized and desynchronized states, asleep and awake states, or inattentive and attentive states in unanesthetized animals.},

Tungsten electrodes were chronically implanted following anesthesia with ketamine/acepromazine. After a recovery period, the chinchillas were placed in a passive restraining device and put in a sound-attenuating booth. Recordings were made from the right IC and AC simultaneously, while a two-tone stimulus was presented to the left ear. The stimuli consisted of two equal-level tones (F1 and F2) that were mixed acoustically; F1 remained constant at 2000 Hz, while F2 varied between 2029 and 2249 Hz, in steps of ∼20 Hz. The stimuli decreased in 10 dB steps from 80 to 30 dB pSPL. Animals were evaluated when unanesthetized, as well as when anesthetized with nembutal (on separate days). In the IC, the administration of nembutal resulted in either no change in ASSR amplitude or an amplitude increase for difference tone (DT) frequencies below 90 Hz, while an amplitude decrease was typically seen for DT frequencies at or above 90 Hz. In the AC, a decrease in amplitude was seen across DT frequencies and stimulus levels after the administration of nembutal anesthesia. Our results suggest that both the AC and IC may contribute to the scalp-recorded ASSR in the awake state. However, in the nembutal-anesthetized state, it seems unlikely that the AC contributes substantially to the surface-recorded ASSR, as the AC response was greatly attenuated under nembutal anesthesia. In contrast, the IC ASSR responses remained robust, which makes it a likely contributor to the surface-recorded responses under nembutal anesthesia. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the process whereby some auditory neurons respond better to rare stimuli than to repetitive stimuli. Most experiments on SSA have been performed under anesthesia, and it is unknown if SSA sensitivity is altered by the anesthetic agent. Only a direct comparison can answer this question. Here, we recorded extracellular single units in the inferior colliculus of awake and anesthetized mice under an oddball paradigm that elicits SSA. Our results demonstrate that SSA is similar, but not identical, in the awake and anesthetized preparations. The differences are mostly due to the higher spontaneous activity observed in the awake animals, which also revealed a high incidence of inhibitory receptive fields. We conclude that SSA is not an artifact of anesthesia and that spontaneous activity modulates neuronal SSA differentially, depending on the state of arousal. Our results suggest that SSA may be especially important when nervous system activity is suppressed during sleep-like states. This may be a useful survival mechanism that allows the organism to respond to danger when sleeping.},

One major issue in preclinical nuclear imaging, as well as in most of the neurophysiological methods investigating auditory processing, is the need of anesthesia. We compared the usability of two types of anesthesia which are frequently employed in electrophysiology, ketamine/xylazine (KX), and fentanyl/midazolam/medetomidine (FMM), for valid measurements of auditory activation with 18 F-FDG PET. Gerbils were placed in a sound-shielding box and injected with 18 F-FDG. Two acoustic free-field conditions were used: (1) baseline (no stimulation, 25 dB background noise) and (2) 90 dB frequency-modulated tones (FM). After 40 min of 18 F-FDG uptake, a 30 min acquisition was performed using a small animal PET/CT system. Blood glucose levels were measured after the uptake phase before scanning. Standardized uptake value ratios for relevant regions were determined after implementing image and volume of interest templates. Scans demonstrated a significantly higher uptake in the inferior colliculus with FM stimulation compared to baseline in awake subjects (+ 12\%; p = 0.02) and with FMM anesthesia (+ 13\%; p = 0.0012), but not with KX anesthesia. In non-auditory brain regions, no significant difference was detected. Blood glucose levels were significantly higher under KX compared to FMM anesthesia (17.29 ± 0.42 mmol/l vs. 14.30 ± 1.91 mmol/l; p = 0.024). These results suggest that valid 18 F-FDG PET measurements of auditory activation comparable to electrophysiology can be obtained from gerbils during opioid-based anesthesia due to its limited effects on interfering blood glucose levels.},

	abstract = {Receptive fields and tuning curves of sensory neurons represent the neural substrates that allow animals to efficiently detect and distinguish external stimuli. They are progressively refined to create diverse sensitivity and selectivity for neurons along ascending central pathways. However, the neural circuitry mechanisms have not been directly determined for such fundamental qualities in relation to sensory neurons' functional organizations, because of the technical difficulty of correlating neurons' input and output. Here, we obtained spike outputs and synaptic inputs from the same neurons within characteristically defined neural ensembles, to determine the synaptic mechanisms driving their diverse frequency selectivity in the mouse inferior colliculus. We find that the synaptic strength and timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs are configured differently and independently within individual neurons' receptive fields, which segregate sensitive and selective neurons and endow neural populations with broad receptive fields and sharp frequency tuning. By computationally modeling spike outputs from integrating synaptic inputs and comparing them with real spike responses of the same neurons, we show that space-clamping errors did not qualitatively affect the estimation of spike responses derived from synaptic currents in in vivo voltage-clamp recordings. These data suggest that heterogeneous inhibitory circuits coexist locally for a parallel but differentiated representation of incoming signals.},

	abstract = {Key points: • Neurons in the auditory midbrain, the inferior colliculus, are selectively sensitive to combinations of sound frequency and level as illustrated by their frequency/level receptive fields. Different receptive field shapes have been described, but we do not know if these represent discrete classes reflecting afferent inputs from individual sources, or a more complex pattern of integration. • In this study we used objective methods to analyse the receptive fields of over 2000 neurons in the guinea pig inferior colliculus. • Subjectively we identified seven different receptive field classes, but objectively these classes formed continua with many neurons having receptive field shapes intermediate to these extremes. • These findings are consistent with neurons receiving inhibitory inputs of different strength and frequency disposition but not consistent with neurons reflecting inputs only from individual brainstem nuclei. • These results are important for understanding the functional organisation of the inferior colliculus and its role in auditory processing. Abstract A differential response to sound frequency is a fundamental property of auditory neurons. Frequency analysis in the cochlea gives rise to V-shaped tuning functions in auditory nerve fibres, but by the level of the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway, neuronal receptive fields display diverse shapes that reflect the interplay of excitation and inhibition. The origin and nature of these frequency receptive field types is still open to question. One proposed hypothesis is that the frequency response class of any given neuron in the IC is predominantly inherited from one of three major afferent pathways projecting to the IC, giving rise to three distinct receptive field classes. Here, we applied subjective classification, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and other objective statistical measures, to a large population (2826) of frequency response areas from single neurons recorded in the IC of the anaesthetised guinea pig. Subjectively, we recognised seven frequency response classes (V-shaped, non-monotonic Vs, narrow, closed, tilt down, tilt up and double-peaked), that were represented at all frequencies. We could identify similar classes using our objective classification tools. Importantly, however, many neurons exhibited properties intermediate between these classes, and none of the objective methods used here showed evidence of discrete response classes. Thus receptive field shapes in the IC form continua rather than discrete classes, a finding consistent with the integration of afferent inputs in the generation of frequency response areas. The frequency disposition of inhibition in the response areas of some neurons suggests that across-frequency inputs originating at or below the level of the IC are involved in their generation. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Nowadays, high-density microelectrode arrays provide unprecedented possibilities to precisely activate spatially well-controlled central nervous system (CNS) areas. However, this requires optimizing stimulating devices, which in turn requires a good understanding of the effects of microstimulation on cells and tissues. In this context, modeling approaches provide flexible ways to predict the outcome of electrical stimulation in terms of CNS activation. In this paper, we present state-of-the-art modeling methods with sufficient details to allow the reader to rapidly build numerical models of neuronal extracellular microstimulation. These include (1) the computation of the electrical potential field created by the stimulation in the tissue, and (2) the response of a target neuron to this field. Two main approaches are described: First we describe the classical hybrid approach that combines the finite element modeling of the potential field with the calculation of the neuron's response in a cable equation framework (compartmentalized neuron models). Then, we present a "whole finite element" approach allowing the simultaneous calculation of the extracellular and intracellular potentials, by representing the neuronal membrane with a thin-film approximation. This approach was previously introduced in the frame of neural recording, but has never been implemented to determine the effect of extracellular stimulation on the neural response at a sub-compartment level. Here, we show on an example that the latter modeling scheme can reveal important sub-compartment behavior of the neural membrane that cannot be resolved using the hybrid approach. The goal of this paper is also to describe in detail the practical implementation of these methods to allow the reader to easily build new models using standard software packages. These modeling paradigms, depending on the situation, should help build more efficient high-density neural prostheses for CNS rehabilitation. © 2014 Joucla, Glière and Yvert.},

In 78\% of the neurons the rate-intensity functions in response to tones and noise were of different shape. We interpret this stimulus dependency of the shape of rate-intensity functions of most neurons as evidence against sound-intensity coding only on the basis of the shape of rate-intensity functions at the ICC level. Rate-intensity functions averaged from neurons with similar characteristic frequencies or from all neurons of our sample indicate a constant average discharge over at least 60 dB sound intensity.

	abstract = {Social vocalizations are particularly important stimuli in an animal's auditory environment. Because of their importance, vocalizations should be strongly represented in auditory pathways. Mice commonly emit ultrasonic vocalizations with spectral content between 45 and 100 kHz. However, there is limited representation of these ultra-high frequencies (particularly those greater than 60 kHz) throughout the ascending auditory system. Here, we show that neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of mice respond strongly to conspecific vocalizations even though the energy in the vocalizations is above the neurons' frequency tuning curves. This results in an over-representation of species-specific vocalizations in the IC. In addition, neurons in mouse IC show selectivity among different vocalizations. Many vocalization-responsive neurons do not respond to the individual ultrasonic frequencies contained within the vocalizations, but they do respond to combinations of ultrasonic tones if the difference between the tones is within the excitatory frequency tuning curve. The combinations of tones that elicit responses are the quadratic and/or cubic intermodulation distortion components that are generated by the cochlea. Thus, the intermodulation distortions in the cochlea may provide a previously overlooked mechanism for auditory processing of complex stimuli such as vocalizations. The implication of these findings is that nonlinear interactions of frequencies, possibly caused by distortions in the system, may be used to enhance the sensitivity to behaviorally important stimuli.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the auditory processing of vocalizations in mice are not well understood. The mouse audiogram shows a peak in sensitivity at frequencies between 15-25 kHz, but weaker sensitivity for the higher ultrasonic frequencies at which they typically vocalize. To investigate the auditory processing of vocalizations in mice, we measured evoked potential, single-unit, and multi-unit responses to tones and vocalizations at three different stages along the auditory pathway: the auditory nerve and the cochlear nucleus in the periphery, and the inferior colliculus in the midbrain. Auditory brainstem response measurements suggested stronger responses in the midbrain relative to the periphery for frequencies higher than 32 kHz. This result was confirmed by singleand multi-unit recordings showing that high ultrasonic frequency tones and vocalizations elicited responses from only a small fraction of cells in the periphery, while a much larger fraction of cells responded in the inferior colliculus. These results suggest that the processing of communication calls in mice is supported by a specialization of the auditory system for high frequencies that emerges at central stations of the auditory pathway.},

All hippocampal units were classified as complex-spike cells or theta cells on the basis of the form of their action potentials and their rates of firing in various behaviors. Field potentials and unit firing evoked from the stimulating electrodes were recorded during slow wave sleep. Complex-spike cells (1) could often be antidromcally activated in CA3 (it was not attempted in CA1); (2) could only be induced to fire one or two action potentials in response to a single stimulus; (3) had action potentials at the same time as the local population-spike and, in condition-test studies, were depressed when the population-spike was depressed. (The population-spike is presumably the summed synchronous action potentials of pyramidal cells.) Theta cells: (1) were antidromically activated in only one out of 25 cases; (2) usually could fire long bursts of action potentials in response to a sufficiently intense single stimulus; (3) this firing occurred before, during, and after the local orthodromic population-spike. Most complex-spike cells in Ammon's horn must be pyramidal cells (projection cells), and vice versa. The case for theta cells is more difficult. Some are non-pyramidal cells with locally ramifying axons, but at least some are projection cells.

Cats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. There was a systematic representation of the cochlea within the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus. The boundary between the pericentral nucleus and underlying central nucleus could be sharply drawn on physiological bases. There was a highly ordered representation of the cochlea across the 3 dimensions of the central nucleus. Neurons within the dorsomedial nucleus and external nucleus of the inferior colliculus were not driven by simple tonal stimulation. The change in best frequency as a function of depth in the colliculus was the same for parallel penetrations entering over almost the entire dorsal surface of the central nucleus. This indicated that a given frequency-band was represented across a laminar figure completely sectioning the nucleus; and that laminae were flat except along the extreme margins of the nucleus. Definition of 'isofrequency contours' from reconstruction of rows of parallel penetrations confirmed these conclusions. Frequency-band laminae were tilted down rostrally, especially in the middle and lateral aspects of the central nucleus. They were also tilted down laterally. Orientation of isofrequency contours paralleled that of laminae described within anatomical studies of the central nucleus29. The disk-shaped regions representing lowest frequency octaves were not as thick nor as extensive as those representing middle and high frequency octaves. However, when best frequency values were converted to corresponding cochlear place, cochlear place was observed to be a nearly linear function of colliculus depth for the representation of the apical half of the cochlear partition. There was a somewhat larger representation, across colliculus depth, of the basal half of the cochlea. The change in best frequency with change of depth in the central nucleus was stepwise. This suggested that small sectors of the basilar membrane of approximately equal length were represented across individual anatomically defined cellular laminae within the nucleus. © 1974.},

This study examined the stability of task-related neural activity associated with execution of two distinct reaching tasks in healthy rodents. A novel automated rodent behavioral apparatus was constructed and rats were trained to perform a reaching task combining a 'gross' lever press and a 'fine' pellet retrieval. In each animal, two chronic microelectrode arrays were implanted in motor cortex spanning the caudal forelimb area (rodent primary motor cortex) and the rostral forelimb area (rodent premotor cortex). We recorded multiunit spiking and local field potential activity from 10 days to 7-10 weeks post-implantation to characterize the patterns of neural activity observed during each task component and analyzed the consistency of channel-specific task-related neural activity. Task-related changes in neural activity were observed on the majority of channels. While the task-related changes in multi-unit spiking and local field potential spectral power were consistent over several weeks, spectral power changes were more stable, despite the trade-off of decreased spatial and temporal resolution. These results show that neural activity in rodent primary and premotor cortex is associated with specific phases of reaching movements with stable patterns of task-related activity across time, establishing the relevance of the rodent for future studies designed to examine changes in task-related neural activity during recovery from focal cortical lesions.},

However, not all of the envelope may be necessary to perceive amplitude modulations (AMs); the effective envelope depth may be limited by forward and backward masking from the envelope peaks. Three experiments used modulated pulse trains to measure which portions of the envelope can be effectively processed by CI users as a function of AM frequency. Experiment 1 used a three-interval forced-choice task to test the ability of CI users to discriminate less-modulated pulse trains from a fully modulated standard, without controlling for loudness. The stimuli in experiment 2 were identical, but a two-interval task was used in which participants were required to choose the less-modulated interval, ignoring loudness. Catch trials, in which judgements based on level or modulation depth would give opposing answers, were included. Experiment 3 employed novel stimuli whose modulation envelope could be modified below a variable point in the dynamic range, without changing the loudness of the stimulus. Overall, results showed that substantial portions of the envelope are not accurately encoded by CI users. In experiment 1, where loudness cues were available, participants on average were insensitive to changes in the bottom 30\% of their dynamic range. In experiment 2, where loudness was controlled, participants appeared insensitive to changes in the bottom 50\% of the dynamic range. In experiment 3, participants were insensitive to changes in the bottom 80\% of the dynamic range. We discuss potential reasons for this insensitivity and implications for CI speech-processing strategies.},

	abstract = {Optogenetic control of neural activity in deep brain regions ideally requires precise and flexible light delivery with non-invasive devices. To this end, Tapered Optical Fibers (TFs) represent a versatile tool that can deliver light over either large brain volumes or spatially confined sub-regions, while being sensibly smaller than flat-cleaved optical fibers. In this work, we report on the possibility of further extending light emission length along the taper in the range 0.4 mm-3.0 mm by increasing the numerical aperture of the TFs to NA = 0.66. We investigated the dependence between the input angle of light (θin) and the output position along the taper, finding that for θin {\textgreater} 10° this relationship is linear. This mode-division demultiplexing property of the taper was confirmed with a ray tracing model and characterized for 473 nm and 561 nm light in quasi-transparent solution and in brain slices, with the two wavelengths used to illuminate simultaneously two different regions of the brain using only one waveguide. The results presented in this manuscript can guide neuroscientists to design their optogenetic experiments on the base of this mode-division demultiplexing approach, providing a tool that potentially allow for dynamic targeting of regions with diverse extension, from the mouse VTA up to the macaque visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Stains for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and retrograde labeling with Fluorogold (FG) were used to study olivocochlear neurons and their dendritic patterns in mice. The two methods gave similar results for location and number of somata. The total number of medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) is about 170 per side. An additional dozen large olivocochlear neurons are located in the dorsal periolivary nucleus (DPO). Dendrites of all of these neurons are long and extend in all directions from the cell bodies, a pattern that contrasts with the sharp frequency tuning of their responses. For VNTB neurons, there were greater numbers of dendrites directed medially than laterally and those directed medially were longer (on average, 25-50\% longer). Dendrite extensions were most pronounced for neurons located in the rostral portion of the VNTB. When each dendrite from a single neuron was represented as a vector, and all the vectors summed, the result was also skewed toward the medial direction. DPO neurons, however, had more symmetric dendrites that projected into more dorsal parts of the trapezoid body, suggesting that this small group of olivocochlear neurons has very different physiological properties. Dendrites of both types of neurons were somewhat elongated rostrally, about 20\% longer than those directed caudally. These results can be interpreted as extensions of dendrites of olivocochlear neurons toward their synaptic inputs: medially to meet crossing fibers from the cochlear nucleus that are part of the MOC reflex pathway, and rostrally to meet descending inputs from higher centers. © 2008 IBRO.},

	abstract = {Improving the electrode-neuron interface to reduce current spread between individual electrodes has been identified as one of the main objectives in the search for future improvements in cochlear-implant performance. Here, we address this problem by presenting a novel stimulation strategy that takes account of the biophysical properties of the auditory neurons (spiral ganglion neurons, SGNs) stimulated in electrical hearing. This new strategy employs a ramped pulse shape, where the maximum amplitude is achieved through a linear slope in the injected current. We present the theoretical framework that supports this new strategy and that suggests it will improve the modulation of SGNs' activity by exploiting their sensitivity to the rising slope of current pulses. The theoretical consequence of this sensitivity to the slope is a reduction in the spread of excitation within the cochlea and, consequently, an increase in the neural dynamic range. To explore the impact of the novel stimulation method on neural activity, we performed in vitro recordings of SGNs in culture. We show that the stimulus efficacy required to evoke action potentials in SGNs falls as the stimulus slope decreases. This work lays the foundation for a novel, and more biomimetic, stimulation strategy with considerable potential for implementation in cochlear-implant technology.},

	abstract = {It is important to know the spatial extent of neural activation around the stimulating electrodes when using extracellular electrical stimulation for the determination of the structure and function of neural circuit connections or for the restoration of function. The current-distance relationship quantifies the relationship between the threshold current for excitation of a neuron, I(th), and the distance between the electrode and the neuron, r, with two parameters: the offset, I(0), and the current-distance constant, k, with a quadratic equation, I(th)(r) = I(0) + kr(2). We proposed a new method to determine the parameters of the current-distance relationship, and thereby estimate the spatial extent of activation, based on the refractory interaction technique. Refractory interaction is a method that exploits the interaction between the regions of activation produced by two electrodes, when the second stimulus is delivered while neurons activated by the first electrode are in their refractory period. Computer simulations of electrical stimulation of a population of nerve fibers were used to determine the accuracy of the method. The mean relative error in k was 19\% and in I(0) was 17\%, and the spatial extent of stimulation could be determined with an absolute error of 19 microm and a relative error less than 11\%. Subsequently, the method was applied to measure the current-distance properties of peripheral motor nerve fibers and indicated that k = 27 microA mm(-2) and I(0) = 49 microA. This method provided robust estimates of the current-distance properties, and provides a means to determine the spatial extent of activation by extracellular stimulation.},

Various approaches have been used to estimate the current- distance relationship and thereby the spatial extent of activation resulting from extracellular stimulation.

We implemented a computer-based model of excitation of a population of nerve fibers and used the model to evaluate a range of approaches proposed for measuring the spatial extent of neural activation. The estimates with each method were compared with measurements of the true spatial extent of activation that were accessible in the simulations to quantify the accuracy of the estimates and to determine the dependence of accuracy on measurement parameters (interelectrode distance, stimulation amplitude, noise).

Wireless alternatives eliminate constraints associated with optical fibers, but their use of head stages with batteries adds bulk and weight that can affect behaviors, with limited operational lifetimes. The systems introduced here avoid drawbacks of both types of technologies, by combining highly miniaturized electronics and energy harvesters with injectable photometric modules in a class of fully wireless, battery-free photometer that is fully implantable subdermally to allow for the interrogation of neural dynamics in freely behaving subjects, without limitations set by fiber optic tethers or operational lifetimes constrained by traditional power supplies. The unique capabilities of these systems, their compatibility with magnetic resonant imaging and computed tomography and the ability to manufacture them with techniques in widespread use for consumer electronics, suggest a potential for broad adoption in neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Single-use commercial surface fiducial markers are used in clinical imaging for a variety of applications. The current study sought to find a new, reliably visible, easily sourced and inexpensive fiducial marker alternative for use with MRI. Design: Five commonly requested MRI sequences were determined (three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted, T1 coronal, 3D T2-weighted, T2 fat suppressed, proton density), to examine the visibility of 18 items (including a commercial fiducial marker). Setting: Clinical 3T MRI scanner in an Australian Tertiary Hospital and an Australian University Biomedical Engineering research group. Interventions: 18 marker alternatives were scanned using five common MRI sequences. Images were reformatted to obtain both an image through the mid-height of each marker and a maximum intensity z-projection image over the volume of the marker. Variations in marker intensity were profiled across each visible marker and a visibility rating defined. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures were based on quantitative assessment of a clear intensity contrast ratio between the marker and the adjacent tissue and a qualitative assessment of visibility via a 3-point scale. Results: The fish oil capsule, vitamin D capsule, paint ball pellet, soy sauce sushi tube and commercial markers were typically visible to a high quality on all the imaging sequences and demonstrated a clear differential in intensity contrast against the adjacent tissue. Other common items, such as plasticine 'play doh' and a soft 'Jelly baby' sweet, were surprise candidates, demonstrating high-quality visibility and intensity contrast for the 3D T1-weighted sequence. Conclusions: Depending on the basis for referral and MRI sequence chosen, four alternative fiducial markers were determined to be inexpensive, easily sourced and consistently visible. Of these, the vitamin D capsule provided an excellent balance between availability, size, cost, usability and quality of the visualised marker for all the commonly used MRI sequences analysed.},

	doi = {10.1118/1.4918753},
	abstract = {Purpose: In radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer, tumor alignment prior to each treatment fraction is improved when intratumoral gold fiducial markers (from here onwards: markers), which are visible on computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT, are used. Visibility of these markers on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might improve image registration between CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images for tumor delineation purposes. However, concomitant image artifacts induced by markers are undesirable. The extent of visibility and artifact size depend on MRI-sequence parameters. The authors' goal was to determine for various markers their potential to be visible and to generate artifacts, using measures that are independent of the MRI-sequence parameters. Methods: The authors selected ten different markers suitable for endoscopic placement in the pancreas and placed them into a phantom. The markers varied in diameter (0.28-0.6 mm), shape, and iron content (0\%-0.5\%). For each marker, the authors calculated T2∗-maps and ΔB0-maps using MRI measurements. A decrease in relaxation time T2∗ can cause signal voids, associated with visibility, while a change in the magnetic field B0 can cause signal shifts, which are associated with artifacts. These shifts inhibit accurate tumor delineation. As a measure for potential visibility, the authors used the volume of low T2∗, i.e., the volume for which T2∗ differed from the background by {\textgreater}15 ms. As a measure for potential artifacts, the authors used the volume for which {\textbar}ΔB0{\textbar} {\textgreater} 9.4×10-8 T (4 Hz). To test whether there is a correlation between visibility and artifact size, the authors calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rs) between the volume of low T2∗ and the volume of high {\textbar}ΔB0{\textbar}. The authors compared the maps with images obtained using a clinical MR-sequence. Finally, for the best visible marker as well as the marker that showed the smallest artifact, the authors compared the phantom data with in vivo MR-images in four pancreatic cancer patients. Results: The authors found a strong correlation (Rs = 1.00, p {\textless} 0.01) between the volume of low T2∗ and the volume with high {\textbar}ΔB0{\textbar}. Visibility in clinical MR-images increased with lower T2∗. Signal shift artifacts became worse for markers with high {\textbar}ΔB0{\textbar}. The marker that was best visible in the phantom, a folded marker with 0.5\% iron content, was also visible in vivo, but showed artifacts on diffusion weighted images. The marker with the smallest artifact in the phantom, a small, stretched, ironless marker, was indiscernible on in vivo MR-images. Conclusions: Changes in T2∗ and ΔB0 are sequence-independent measures for potential visibility and artifact size, respectively. Improved visibility of markers correlates strongly to signal shift artifacts; therefore, marker choice will depend on the clinical purpose. When visibility of the markers is most important, markers that contain iron are optimal, preferably in a folded configuration. For artifact sensitive imaging, small ironless markers are best, preferably in a stretched configuration.},

	abstract = {Purpose: X-ray-based position verification of the target volume in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently performed on solid fiducial markers that are implanted under endoscopic ultrasonography. A new biodegradable liquid fiducial marker has recently been introduced. To assess its potential use for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided photon or proton radiotherapy of PDAC, the MRI visibility and artifacts of this marker were quantified and compared against solid gold markers. Material and methods: Different spherical volumes (10 μL, 25 μL, 50 μL, and 100 μL) of a biodegradable liquid fiducial marker as well as seven differently sized and oriented solid gold (0.35 mm diameter; 5 mm and 10 mm length) and iron-gold alloy fiducial markers (0.28 mm diameter; 1 cm and 2 cm length) were implanted in a spherical gel phantom, mimicking the proton spin relaxation properties of healthy pancreatic tissue at 3 Tesla. MR relaxometry was performed to quantify the size and magnitude of the decrease in the effective transversal relaxation time T∗2 and relative proton density ρ(H) as a measure of potential visibility and to quantify the size and magnitude of the increase in magnetic field inhomogeneity ΔB0 as a measure of potential signal artifacts. The phantom was scanned in a 3.0 T PET/MR scanner with an eight-channel head coil. Results: The solid fiducial markers showed a direct linear relationship between the potentially visible size and artifact size. The liquid fiducial marker showed a tendency toward a potentially visible size at smaller artifacts. Liquid markers from 25 to 100 μL generated visible volumes comparable to the size of the solid markers. The magnitude of visibility was the highest for the liquid fiducial marker with volumes of 25-100 μL showing no correlation with the magnitude of artifact. The solid markers showed a strong nonlinear correlation between magnitude of visibility and artifact, whereas the solid marker consisting of a gold-iron alloy induced the strongest artifacts. Conclusion: The liquid fiducial marker causes signal voids on MRI due to its absence of water hydrogen atoms without strongly affecting the magnetic field in the surrounding tissue. The alteration of the static magnetic field was found to be the main effect leading to the visibility of the solid fiducial markers. Hence, especially when a low level of image distortion is required, MRI characteristics of the liquid marker surpass those of solid gold markers currently being used for IGRT of PDAC.},

The excitatory responses from DCN units were usually within a range of 1.8-2.8 ms and these responses were probably the result of monosynaptic input from the auditory nerve. Latencies {\textgreater} 2.8 ms were most likely due to activation of di- and poly-synaptic pathways from auditory nerve fibres, except that latencies between 3.5-4.75 in hearing animals could have arisen from electrophonic mechanisms.

In this review, we survey four stimulus-response phenomena that in recent years are thought to be relevant for cochlear implant stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs): refractoriness, facilitation, accommodation, and spike rate adaptation. Of these four, refractoriness is the most widely known, and many perceptual and physiological studies interpret their data in terms of refractoriness without incorporating facilitation, accommodation, or spike rate adaptation. In reality, several or all of these behaviors are likely involved in shaping neural responses, particularly at higher stimulation rates. A better understanding of the individual and combined effects of these phenomena could assist in developing improved cochlear implant stimulation strategies. We review the published physiological data for electrical stimulation of SGNs that explores these four different phenomena, as well as some of the recent studies that might reveal the biophysical bases of these stimulus-response phenomena.},

Thus, the inwardly rectifying I‐V characteristics of cells in the DCN distinguish them from those of ventral cochlear nuclear neurones (Oertel, 1983). 3. When depolarized with current, most cells fired trains of large, all‐or‐none action potentials. The undershoot after single spikes comprised an initial, fast component followed by a second, slower wave. A few cells (15\%) generated bursts of smaller, graded spikes in addition to the large ones. 4. Repetitive firing evoked by depolarizing pulses of current was followed by an after‐hyperpolarization whose magnitude depended on the strength and duration of the preceding current pulse. 5. Blocking the large action potentials with tetrodotoxin (TTX) revealed Ca2+‐dependent spikes in all cells examined. 6. The steady‐state I‐V relationship became linear in the presence of TTX, suggesting that a persistent Na+ conductance probably mediates the inward rectification seen above the resting potential. 7. Muscarine at micromolar concentrations excited cells and increased their input resistance. © 1988 The Physiological Society},

	abstract = {Current cochlear prostheses use amplitude-modulated pulse trains to encode acoustic signals. In this study we examined the responses of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons to sinusoidal amplitude-modulated pulses and compared the maximum unmodulated pulse rate (Fmax) to which they responded with the maximum modulation frequency (maxFm) that they followed. Consistent with previous results, responses to unmodulated pulses were all low-pass functions of pulse rate. Mean Fmax to unmodulated pulses was 104 pulses per second (pps) and modal Fmax was 60 pps. Above Fmax IC neurons ceased responding except for an onset burst at the beginning of the stimulus. However, IC neurons responded to much higher pulse rates when these pulses were amplitude modulated; 74\% were relatively insensitive to carrier rate and responded to all modulated carriers including those exceeding 600 pps. In contrast, the responses of these neurons (70\%) were low-pass functions of modulation frequency, and the remaining (30\%) had band-pass functions with a maxFm of 42 and 34 Hz, respectively. Thus temporal resolution of IC neurons for modulated frequencies is significantly lower than that for unmodulated pulses. These two measures of temporal resolution (Fmax and maxFm) were uncorrelated (r2 = 0.101). Several parameters influenced the amplitude and temporal structure of modulation responses including modulation depth, overall intensity and modulation-to-carrier rate ratio. We observed distortions in unit responses to amplitude-modulated signals when this ratio was 1/4 to 1/6. Since most current cochlear implant speech processors permit ratios that are significantly greater than this, severe distortion and signal degradation may occur frequently in these devices.},

	abstract = {Type II and type III units in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of unanesthetized (decerebrate) cats are those with excitatory responses to best frequency (BF) tones at all levels above threshold. They are distinguished from type IV units which give predominantly inhibitory responses to tones. Type II and type III units are distinguished from one another by their rates of spontaneous activity. Type II units have low rates of spontaneous activity (below 2.5 spikes/s), whereas type HI units are spontaneously active at rates up to 95 spikes/s. In this paper we show that segregation of units according to spontaneous activity produces a segregation of several other properties as well. A typical type II unit responds vigorously to BF tones (median maximum rate of 242 spikes/s), has a slightly nonmonotonic rate versus level function, and responds weakly or not at all to broadband noise. These units tend to be located in the deep layer of the DCN. Type III units tend to respond to BF tones at moderate rates (median maximum driven rate of 124 spikes/s), have monotonie or nonmonotonic rate versus level functions, and respond to noise at rates comparable to their tone rates. They are distributed somewhat more uniformly in all DCN layers, but a majority were found in the fusiform cell and molecular layers. Most evidence indicates that type II units are recorded from inhibitory interneurons in the DCN. © 1982.},

Photobiomodulation (PBM) employs light energy to enhance or modulate the activities of specific organs, and is a popular non-invasive therapy used to treat skin lesions and neurodegenerative disorders. Efforts to use PBM to improve hearing have been ongoing for several decades. Initial in vitro studies using cell lines and ex vivo culture techniques have now been supplanted by in vivo studies in animals; PBM protects the sensory epithelium and triggers neural regeneration. Many reports have used PBM to treat tinnitus. In this brief review, we introduce PBM applications in hearing research, helpful protocols, and relevant background literature.},

The lack of information about the pathophysiology of this disease limits early diagnosis and further treatment. Laser therapy is a novel approach to enhance nerve growth or induce axonal regeneration. We induced auditory neural degeneration sparing the sensory epithelium with local ouabain application in an animal model and observed the rescue effect of photobiomodulation (PBM), showing recovered auditory function and favorable histologic outcome. Hearing was evaluated using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). Seven days after ouabain application, the animals were sacrificed to evaluate the morphological changes. DPOAE change was not observed in all groups after ouabain application indicating no changes of outer hair cell function. Ouabain application increased the ABR thresholds increase, while the use of ouabain plus laser produced lower threshold compared to the ouabain group. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of cochlea mid-modiolar sections in animals treated with ouabain showed damaged spiral ganglion cells, neurofilaments, and post synaptic puncta. Ouabain plus laser group showed higher number of spiral ganglion cells, higher density of neurofilaments, and higher number post synaptic puncta counts compared with ouabain application group. Short-term application of ouabain caused spiral ganglion cell damage while sparing the inner and outer hair cells in gerbils. Photobiomodulation alleviated the hearing loss caused by ouabain induced auditory neuropathy. The results indicate the possible role of photobiomodulation therapy for inner ear diseases accompanied by spiral ganglion degeneration.},

No significant difference in ABR threshold was found in the PBM-treated groups (excluding the group with TM damage).

Here, we show, using cochlear functional assays and confocal imaging of the inner ear in mouse, that acoustic overexposures causing moderate, but completely reversible, threshold elevation leave cochlear sensory cells intact, but cause acute loss of afferent nerve terminals and delayed degeneration of the cochlear nerve. Results suggest that noise-induced damage to the ear has progressive consequences that are considerably more widespread than are revealed by conventional threshold testing. This primary neurodegeneration should add to difficulties hearing in noisy environments, and could contribute to tinnitus, hyperacusis, and other perceptual anomalies commonly associated with inner ear damage.

	abstract = {Prior work has provided extensive documentation of threshold sensitivity and sensory hair cell losses after noise exposure. It is now clear, however, that cochlear synaptic loss precedes such losses, at least at low-moderate noise doses, silencing affected neurons. To address questions of whether, and how, cochlear synaptopathy and underlying mechanisms change as noise dose is varied, we assessed cochlear physiologic and histologic consequences of a range of exposures varied in duration from 15 min to 8 h and in level from 85 to 112 dB SPL. Exposures delivered to adult CBA/CaJ mice produced acute elevations in hair cell- and neural-based response thresholds ranging from trivial (∼5 dB) to large (∼50 dB), followed by varying degrees of recovery. Males appeared more noise vulnerable for some conditions of exposure. There was little to no inner hair cell (IHC) loss, but outer hair cell (OHC) loss could be substantial at highest frequencies for highest noise doses. Synapse loss was an early manifestation of noise injury and did not scale directly with either temporary or permanent threshold shift. With increasing noise dose, synapse loss grew to ∼50\%, then declined for exposures yielding permanent hair cell injury/loss. All synaptopathic, but no non-synaptopathic exposures produced persistent neural response amplitude declines; those additionally yielding permanent OHC injury/loss also produced persistent reductions in OHC-based responses and exaggerated neural amplitude declines. Findings show that widespread cochlear synaptopathy can be present with and without noise-induced sensory cell loss and that differing patterns of cellular injury influence synaptopathic outcomes.},

The method terminates level averaging of ABR recordings upon detection of time-locked waveform through cross-correlation analysis. The threshold level was then indicated by a dramatic increase in the sweep numbers required to produce “qualified” level averaging. A good match was obtained between the algorithm outcome and the human readouts. Moreover, the method varies the level averaging based on the cross-correlation, thereby adapting to the signal-to-noise ratio of sweep recordings.

The inner-ear-specific biomarkers detected in peripheral blood included otolin-1, prestin, and matrilin-1. Various serum antibodies correlated with inner ear diseases (e.g., anti-type II collagen, antinuclear antibodies, antibodies against cytomegalovirus). Further studies are advised to elucidate the clinical significance and diagnostic or prognostic usage of peripheral biomarkers for inner ear disorders, filling in the literature gaps with biomarkers pertinent to the otology clinical practice and integrating functional and molecular biomarkers.

Photobiomodulation has the potential for therapeutic utility, reducing cell loss to apoptosis in injured neurological tissue, as demonstrated in this in vitro model. A clear Raman spectroscopic signal was observed after apparent optimal irradiation, potentially integrable into therapeutic light delivery apparatus for real-time dose metering.},

	abstract = {The gold standard method for visualizing the pathologies underlying human sensorineural hearing loss has remained post-mortem histology for over 125 years, despite awareness that histological preparation induces severe artifacts in biological tissue. Historically, the transition from post-mortem assessment to non-invasive clinical biomedical imaging in living humans has revolutionized diagnosis and treatment of disease; however, innovation in non-invasive techniques for cellular-level intracochlear imaging in humans has been difficult due to the cochlea's small size, complex 3D configuration, fragility, and deep encasement within bone. Here we investigate the ability of synchrotron radiation-facilitated X-ray absorption and phase contrast imaging to enable visualization of sensory cells and nerve fibers in the cochlea's sensory epithelium in situ in 3D intact, non-decalcified, unstained human temporal bones. Our findings show that this imaging technique resolves the bone-encased sensory epithelium's cytoarchitecture with unprecedented levels of cellular detail for an intact, unstained specimen, and is capable of distinguishing between healthy and damaged epithelium. All analyses were performed using commercially available software that quickly reconstructs and facilitates 3D manipulation of massive data sets. Results suggest that synchrotron radiation phase contrast imaging has the future potential to replace histology as a gold standard for evaluating intracochlear structural integrity in human specimens, and motivate further optimization for translation to the clinic., "High-resolution secondary reconstructions with the use of flat panel CT in the clinical assessment of patients with cochlear implants," AJNR Am.},

How AGs enter the cochlea and then target HCs remains unresolved. Here, we performed time-lapse multicellular imaging of cochlea in live adult hearing mice via a chemo-mechanical coch-leostomy. The in vivo tracking revealed that systemically administered Texas Red-labeled gentamicin (GTTR) enters the cochlea via the stria vascularis and then HCs selectively. GTTR uptake into HCs was completely abolished in transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1) knockout mice, indicating mechanotransducer channel-dependent AG uptake. Blockage of megalin, the candidate AG transporter in the stria vascularis, by binding competitor cilastatin prevented GTTR accumulation in HCs. Furthermore, cilastatin treatment markedly reduced AG-induced HC degeneration and hearing loss in vivo. Together, our in vivo real-time tracking of megalin-dependent AG transport across the blood-labyrinth barrier identifies new therapeutic targets for preventing AG-induced ototoxicity. in vivo cochlear imaging j drug tracking j aminoglycoside j ototoxicity j megalin},

In the present study, we assessed the mechanism of PBM as a novel treatment for noise-induced hearing loss, focusing on the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to 1-octave band noise centered at 4 kHz for 5 h (121 dB). After noise exposure, their right ears were irradiated with an 808 nm diode laser beam at an output power density of 165 mW/cm2 for 30 min a day for 5 consecutive days. Measurement of the auditory brainstem response revealed an accelerated recovery of auditory function in the groups treated with PBM compared with the non-treatment group at 4, 7, and 14 days after noise exposure. Immunofluorescent image analysis for inducible nitric oxide synthase and cleaved caspase-3 showed lesser immunoreactivities in outer hair cells in the PBM group compared with the non-treatment group. However, immunofluorescent image analysis for NF-κB, an upstream protein of inducible nitric oxide synthase, revealed greater activation in the PBM group compared with the naïve and non-treatment groups. Western blot analysis for NF-κB also showed stronger activation in the cochlear tissues in the PBM group compared with the naïve and non-treatment groups (p{\textless}0.01, each). These data suggest that PBM activates NF-κB to induce protection against inducible nitric oxide synthase-triggered oxidative stress and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis that occur following noise-induced hearing loss.},

Flexible and adaptive constraints are introduced in the optimization procedure by means of eight rules. Several data samples were used in this study. The determination of parameters was performed through 270 BAEPs from 20 subjects with normal and high audiometric thresholds and through additional BAEPs from 123 normal ears and 14 ears showing prominent wave VI BAEPs. The evaluation of the detection performance was performed in two steps: first, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were estimated using 283 BAEPs from 20 subjects showing normal and high audiometric thresholds and secondly, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the detection and the accuracy of the response threshold were estimated using 213 BAEPs from 18 patients in clinic. Taking into account some a priori information, the accuracy in BAEPs detection was enhanced from 76 to 90\%. The patient response thresholds were determined with a mean error of 5 dB and a standard deviation error of 8.3 dB.

Scand Audiol 1984, 13 (219-228). Detection of an auditory brainstem response, ABR, usually relies on visual evaluation of two or more data acquisition runs of a fixed number of sweeps to determine if there is sufficient replication of the averaged waveforms to indicate a response. Visual interpretation can be difficult when the signal-to-noise ratio is poor because of either a small response or high levels of physiological background noise. Moreover, variations in the background noise from run to run can result in poor or spurious replications of component peaks and troughs in the waveform. A previous study (Elberling \& Don, 1984) described a statistical approach for objective evaluation of the quality of an ABR recording. The method uses variance analysis in calculating the ratio of the magnitude of the ABR to the estimated averaged background noise. This study further applies this method to obtain a quantitative definition of the ABR threshold, to demonstrate its application in automatic threshold detection, and to estimate the number of sweeps required to reach detection criterion. Application of this method is valuable in reducing the variability of test interpretation and in maximizing the efficiency of recording ABRs by avoiding the averaging of excessive or insufficient numbers of sweeps. These improvements enhance the cost-benefit of ABR testing to the patient. © 1984, Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An audiologist would look for evidence of wave V in the time domain waveform when assessing threshold level, but also take into account the morphology of the waveform. When a fast Fourier transform (FFT), is applied to the data, it shows dominant frequencies around 200, 500 and 900Hz. This can provide an alternative description of morphology. Software models are created to characterize the waveform at different stimulus intensity levels. They use information from both the time and frequency domains of the BER as input for an expert system.

	abstract = {Objective: The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an evoked response obtained from brain electrical activity when an auditory stimulus is applied to the ear. An audiologist can determine the threshold level of hearing by applying stimuli at reducing levels of intensity, and can also diagnose various otological, audiological, and neurological abnormalities by examining the morphology of the waveform and the latencies of the individual waves. This is a subjective process requiring considerable expertise. The aim of this research was to develop software classification models to assist the audiologist with an automated detection of the ABR waveform and also to provide objectivity and consistency in this detection. Materials and methods: The dataset used in this study consisted of 550 waveforms derived from tests using a range of stimulus levels applied to 85 subjects ranging in hearing ability. Each waveform had been classified by a human expert as 'response = Yes' or 'response = No'. Individual software classification models were generated using time, frequency and cross-correlation measures. Classification employed both artificial neural networks (NNs) and the C5.0 decision tree algorithm. Accuracies were validated using six-fold cross-validation, and by randomising training, validation and test datasets. Results: The result was a two stage classification process whereby strong responses were classified to an accuracy of 95.6\% in the first stage. This used a ratio of post-stimulus to pre-stimulus power in the time domain, with power measures at 200, 500 and 900 Hz in the frequency domain. In the second stage, outputs from time, frequency and cross-correlation classifiers were combined using the Dempster-Shafer method to produce a hybrid model with an accuracy of 85\% (126 repeat waveforms). Conclusion: By combining the different approaches a hybrid system has been created that emulates the approach used by an audiologist in analysing an ABR waveform. Interpretation did not rely on one particular feature but brought together power and frequency analysis as well as consistency of subaverages. This provided a system that enhanced robustness to artefacts while maintaining classification accuracy. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

ABR is an important potential signal for determining objective audiograms. Its detection is usually performed by medical experts with often basic signal processing techniques. The proposed system comprises of two stages. In the first stage, for feature extraction, a set of raw amplitude values, a set of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients and a set of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) approximation coefficients are calculated and extracted from signals separately as three different sets of feature vectors. These features are then selected by a modified adaptive method, which mainly supports to the input dimension reduction via selecting the most significant feature components. In the second stage, the feature vectors are classified by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier which is a powerful advanced technique for solving supervised binary classification problem due to its generalization ability. After that the proposed system is applied to real ABR data and it is resulted in a very good sensitivity, specificity and accuracy levels for DCT coefficients such as 99.2\%, 94.0\% and 96.2\%, respectively. Consequently, the proposed system can be used for recognition of ABRs for hearing threshold detection. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are used to study auditory acuity in animal-based medical research. ABRs are evoked by acoustic stimuli, and consist of an electrical signal resulting from summated activity in the auditory nerve and brainstem nuclei. ABR analysis determines the sound intensity at which a neural response first appears (hearing threshold). Traditionally, threshold has been assessed by visual estimation of a series of ABRs evoked by different sound intensities. Here we develop an automated threshold detection method that eliminates the variability and subjectivity associated with visual estimation. Results: The automated method is a robust computational procedure that detects the sound level at which the peak amplitude of the evoked ABR signal first exceeds four times the standard deviation of the baseline noise. Implementation of the procedure was achieved by evoking ABRs in response to click and tone stimuli, under normal and experimental conditions (adult stem cell transplantation into cochlea). Automated detection revealed that the threshold shift from pre- to post-surgery hearing levels was similar in mice receiving stem cell transplantation or sham injection for click and tone stimuli. Visual estimation by independent observers corroborated these results but revealed variability in ABR threshold shifts and significance levels for stem cell-transplanted and sham-injected animals. Conclusion: In summary, the automated detection method avoids the subjectivity of visual analysis and offers a rapid, easily accessible http://axograph.com/source/abr.html approach to measure hearing threshold levels in auditory brainstem response. © 2009 Bogaerts et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The effects of gradually acquired forms deafness on these synapses are less well understood. We investigated VCN gross morphology and auditory nerve synapse integrity in DBA/2J mice with early-onset progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing status was confirmed using auditory brainstem response audiometry and acoustic startle responses. We found no change in VCN volume, number of macroneurons, or number of VGLUT1-positive auditory nerve terminals between young adult and older, deaf DBA/2J. Cell-type specific analysis revealed no difference in the number of VGLUT1 puncta contacting bushy and multipolar cell body profiles, but the terminals were smaller in deaf DBA/2J mice. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of numerous healthy, vesicle-filled auditory nerve synapses in older, deaf DBA/2J mice. The present results suggest that synapses can be preserved over a relatively long time-course in gradually acquired deafness. Elucidating the mechanisms supporting survival of central auditory nerve synapses in models of acquired deafness may reveal new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.},

Altogether 97 mice were used in the study. Je/je mice never develop any hearing. The dorsal (DCN) and ventral (VCN) cochlear nuclei were found to have stopped their growth at 56 days after birth. In je/+ mutants, ABR thresholds remained normal or near-normal for 3-6 months, whereas VCN and DCN volumes remained unchanged at least after 56 days after birth. There is no significant difference in DCN volume in je/je and je/+ mice. However, the VCN volume and the cross-sectional area of globular cells were both significantly larger in je/+ than in je/je mice (P {\textless} 0.01). These findings show that auditory deprivation during the maturation of hearing in je/je mutants causes an incomplete maturation of only the ventral cochlear nucleus.},

	abstract = {Right cochleae were aspirated from 6‐day‐old mice to determine the influence of cochlear integrity on the development of cochlear nucleus (CN). At 45 days of age, cochlear destruction was confirmed histologically, and the CN of unilaterally deafferented and control animals were analyzed morphometrically. The molecular, fusiform, and polymorphic layers of deafferented dorsal CN were reduced in volume, and the polymorphic layer neurons were fewer, smaller, and less dense. The octopus and multipolar cell regions in deafferented ventral CN (VCN) were smaller, and their neurons were fewer, smaller, and more densely packed. The VCN globular and small spherical cell regions were also smaller with fewer, denser, but normal‐sized neurons. There were fewer VCN large spherical cells, but no change was measured in their size. The granule cell regions throughout CN were also reduced in volume. Overall, CN was reduced to 46\% of its normal size and 34\% of its normal neuronal numbers. These results in the mouse show that deafferentation before the onset of hearing causes more severe CN changes than those reported after adult deafferentation in other mammals and support the theory of a critical period in development when presynaptic integrity is much more important for neuronal maturation than it is for maintenance after the neuron is mature. This suggests that any congenital pathology that compromises the sensorineural structures of the cochlea may cause severe structural and functional abnormalities in the maturing central auditory nuclei.

For this study, cochleas and brains of five adult homozygotes (dn/dn) and five adult heterozygotes (+ /dn). matched by weight and sex, were prepared for serial section light microscopy. In the homozygotes, the organ of Corti was totally degenerated basally, gradually improving toward the apex where supporting cells, border cells and pillar cells were present; however, the stria vascularis was dystrophic in the apex. The saccular macula was atrophied or dystrophic in seven of the ten homozygote ears. The homozygotes had only 23\% of the number of spiral ganglion cells found in the heterozygotes, but they appeared robust. In six of the ears of each group there was clumping of apical spiral ganglion neurons. In the homozygotes, the volume of Rosenthal's canal was 1218, that of the dorsal nuclei was 90\%, and that of the ventral cochlear nuclei was 63\% of the comparable volumes in heterozygotes. The globular cells of the homozygote ventral cochlear nucleus were 724 of the size of those of heterozygotes. These quantitative morphological abnormalities of the homozygote spiral ganglion and cochlear nuclei may result from organ of Corti atrophy. deafness mice; organ of Corti; spiral ganglion; Rosenthal's canal; cochlear nuclei},

	abstract = {Using serial sections stained with luxol fast blue‐cresyl violet, the cochlear nuclei of CBA/J mice were parcellated into the same cytoarchitectonic areas and layers that Osen (1969) used in cats. Within the spherical cell areas, the distribution of Nissl substance is more reliable than soma shape in identifying the spherical cells. The area of large spherical cells is extremely small in CBA/J mice but does contain significantly larger neurons than the small spherical cell area. In Golgi preparations, bushy cells are found in all areas of the ventral cochlear nucleus except in the octopus cell area and granule cell layer. They are more numerous anteriorly than posteriorly and details of their morphology are quite variable. Stellate cells are found throughout the ventral cochlear nuclei but are present in greatest numbers in the multipolar cell area; they are rare in the large spherical cell area and octopus cell area. Because size, soma morphology, and dendritic arborization vary on a continuum rather than in discrete steps, we have not subcategorized these neurons. Octopus cells are restricted to the posterior, dorsomedial area of the ventral cochlear nucleus. In the central region of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, stellate cells abound and are categorized as vertical, elongate, or radiate cells. In the granule layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus there are both fusiform and Purkinje‐like neurons, so named because of their resemblance to cerebellar Purkinje cells. These Purkinje‐like cells differ from fusiform cells in having (1) a smaller cell body, spherical in shape, (2) no basal dendrites, (3) a sagittal dendritic orientation, (4) elaborate dendritic branching, and (5) abundant dendritic spines.

	abstract = {A major limitation of the present auditory brainstem implant (ABI) is its inability to access the tonotopic organization of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). A previous study by our group indicated that stimulation of single sites within a given VCN frequency region did not always elicit frequency-specific responses within the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CIC) and in some cases did not elicit a response at all. For this study, we hypothesized that sequential stimulation (with a short interpulse delay of 320 μsec) of two VCN sites in similar frequency regions would enhance responsiveness in CIC neurons. Multiunit neural recordings in response to pure tones were obtained at 58 VCN and 164 CIC sites in anesthetized rats. Among the 58 VCN sites, 39 pairs of sites with similar characteristic frequencies were chosen for electrical stimulation. Each member of a VCN pair was electrically stimulated individually, followed by sequential stimulation of the pair, while recording CIC responses. On average, CIC sites were found to respond to dual-site VCN stimulation with significantly lower thresholds, wider dynamic ranges, a greater extent of activation with increasing current levels, and a higher degree of frequency specificity compared with single-site stimulation. Although these effects were positive for the most part, in some cases dual-site stimulation resulted in increased CIC thresholds and decreased dynamic ranges, extent of activation, and frequency specificity. The results suggest that multisite stimulation within VCN isofrequency laminae using penetrating electrodes could significantly improve ABI stimulation strategies and implant performance. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
